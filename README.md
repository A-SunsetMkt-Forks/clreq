# Requirements for Chinese Text Layout | 中文排版需求

This group exists to explore gaps and requirements for support of languages using Simplified and Traditional Chinese on the Web and in eBooks.

It aims to address the problem that experts often don't know how to tell the W3C what problems exist for support of their script on the Web, and the W3C often doesn't know how to contact people who can help when questions arise.

Some experts may go a step further, and contribute to a gap-analysis or requirements document.

Topics for discussion are suggested by [the gap-analysis template](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html). This work feeds into the [language matrix](http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) which gives an overview of languages needing attention.

### Documents 文档
- [Chinese Layout Gap Analysis](https://w3c.github.io/clreq/gap-analysis/)
- [Requirements for Chinese Text Layout | 中文排版需求 (ED)](https://w3c.github.io/clreq/) ([WD](https://www.w3.org/TR/clreq/))

### Feedback 反馈
Please use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/clreq/issues) to report issues for language support, for discussions, and to send feedback about documents.

### Following 跟踪
Rather than just 'Watch' this repository, it is best to subscribe to the [public-i18n-cjk](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-arabic/) mailing list. That list is notified once a day (in digest form) about not only changes to this repository, but also about other W3C Working Group issues related to the Chinese writing systems. (Please use github issues rather than the mailing list to send feedback.)  Meeting minutes are also sent to public-i18n-cjk.

You can find a list of open issues, including those from W3C Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=han) page. (That link applies a `han` filter.)
