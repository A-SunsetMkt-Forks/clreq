# Requirements for Chinese Text Layout | 中文排版需求

This group explores gaps and requirements for support of languages using Simplified and Traditional Chinese on the Web and in eBooks.

该小组提供了一个讨论在 Web 和电子书中简体中文和繁体中文支持情况和排版需求的平台。

It aims to address the problem that experts often don't know how to tell the W3C what problems exist for support of their script on the Web, and the W3C often doesn't know how to contact people who can help when questions arise.

小组旨在解决人们不了解如何反馈 Web 上中文支持问题的情况，以及当问题出现时，W3C 缺少语言专家的反馈的情况。

Some experts go a step further, and contribute to a gap-analysis or requirements document.

一些语言和排版专家除了回答问题之外，也会更深入地参与小组工作，为差距分析或需求文档做出贡献。

Topics for discussion are suggested by [the gap-analysis template](https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html). This work feeds into the [language matrix](https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) which gives an overview of languages needing attention.  The focus is especially on typographic features for which information in English is typically hard to find, such as justification, letter-spacing, vertical text, text decoration, page layout, emphasis, etc. We want to ensure that we have captured local user needs in CSS, HTML, Timed Text, Web Payments, Web Publishing, and the many other specifications that the W3C produces.

### Following 跟踪

Rather than just 'Watch' this repository, it is best to subscribe to the [public-i18n-cjk](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-cjk/) mailing list. That list is notified once a day (in digest form) about not only changes to this repository, but also about other W3C Working Group issues related to the Chinese writing systems. (Please use github issues rather than the mailing list to send feedback. The main purpose of the public-i18n-mongolian mailing list is for notifications; meeting minutes are also sent to public-i18n-cjk.)

You can find a list of open issues, including those from W3C Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=clreq) page. (That link applies a `clreq` filter.)

### Contributing 贡献

All contributors should read and agree with [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/w3c/clreq/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Please use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/clreq/issues) to report issues for language support, for discussions, and to send feedback about documents.  (Learn [how GitHub issues work](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/issues.html).)

**You may raise issues in Chinese, however any substantive discussions should be summarised in English at some point, so that non-Chinese speakers can follow the rationale and contribute comments.**

Group _members_ are expert contributors who participate actively in producing the work of the group, regularly contributing text and advice to create the outputs, and participating in meetings. For more information about becoming a task force member contact [Richard Ishida](mailto:ishida@w3.org). We welcome participation requests.
