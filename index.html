        <h3>How This Document Was Created</h3>
        <p>Chinese composition exhibits several differences from other writing systems. The major features include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> There are two written scripts in Chinese, using traditional and simplified characters. Apart from the differences between glyphs and strokes, the composition rules can be different as well.</li>
          <li> There are two writing modes: vertical and horizontal. The former is often seen in Traditional Chinese publications.</li>
          <li> In principal, the characters, including Chinese (hanzi) characters and punctuation, used in Chinese composition are squares with the ratio of 1:1, and are seamlessly arranged with one another.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This document mainly adopts the following policies to explain the features of Chinese composition:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> It does not fully cover all details of the Chinese composition system, but mainly describes the differences from Western composition systems.</li>
        <li> It explains in detail the similarities and differences between traditional and simplified Chinese composition.</li>
        <li> It describes features of Chinese composition that differ from those mentioned in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/">Requirements for Japanese Text Layout</a>.</li>
        <li> It describes presentational results and considers these results as issues and requirements for Chinese text layout. Meanwhile, it offers principles or methods for for handling these issues, without describing particular technological solutions.</li>
        <li> It suggests solutions for, or explains, present-day issues that people face in Chinese composition.</li>
        <li> It provides typical instances of Chinese composition and their actual use cases as much as possible.</li>
        <li> In consideration of non-Chinese readers of this document, figures are used for explanation wherever possible.</li>
        <li> It mainly explains modern Chinese publications. Looking back to the publications in the time of movable type, there may be some differences, but they are still considered part of Chinese composition. The document does not yet fully cover ancient books. Future editions may be revised with such features in mind.</li>
        <li> For non-Chinese readers, frequency of use is indicated for each requirement. These frequencies are not the outcome of any accurate research, but arise from the long experience of the authors. Non-Chinese readers should understand that they are intuitive for ordinary Chinese readers. These frequencies provide only rough information to prioritize the importance of issues.</li>
        <li> The main target of this document is common books. Other publications, such as magazines or newspapers, are also included.</li>

          <section>
          <h4>Characters Used for Chinese Composition</h4>
          <p>It is mainly Chinese (hanzi) characters that are used for Chinese composition. </p>
          <p>Chinese characters include Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese alternatives. The former is commonly used in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao while the latter is commonly used in Mainland China, Singapore and Malaysia. In this document, the number of strokes and the compositional nature of a character are considered to be the major differences between Simplified Chinese characters and Traditional Chinese characters. </p>
          <p>Different typefaces are used different in regions. The presentational aspects of typefaces do not have a relationship to Unicode, but rather depend on the operating system and the character library. The focus of this document is Chinese composition and we will not discuss typeface presentation. </p>
          <p class="note">In addition to the Chinese (hanzi) characters, various punctuation marks, as well as Western characters such as Arabic numerals, Latin letters and/or Greek letters, may be used in Chinese text. </p>
          <p class="note">One Simplified Chinese character may have more than one corresponding traditional form. For example, the Simplified Chinese character 发 can be matched to either the Traditional Chinese character 發 or 髮, depending on the context. </p>
          </section>
          
          
            <section>
          <h4>Chinese Characters</h4>
          <p>Chinese characters have square <dfn>character frames</dfn> of equal dimensions. Aligned with the vertical and horizontal center of the character frame, there is a smaller box called the <dfn>letter face</dfn>, which contains the actual symbol. (There should be some space left between the letter face and the frame). Most of the punctuation marks for Chinese characters share the same size as the other characters, however some of them differ, such as the ellipsis, which is one-character high and two-characters wide.</p>
          <p>Character size is measured by the size of the character frame. <dfn>Character advance</dfn> is a term used to describe the advance width of the character frame of a character. The frame of a Chinese character should be a square. </p>
            </section>
          
          
            <section>
          <h4>Principles for Arranging Characters during Chinese Composition</h4>
          <p>In principle, when composing a line with Chinese characters, no extra space appears between their character frames. This is called <dfn>solid setting</dfn>. </p>
          <p class="note">Unlike the letterpress printing era, when several sizes of the original pattern of a letter were required to create matrices, in today's digital era the same original pattern is used for any size simply by enlargement or reduction. Because of this, it might be necessary to adjust the inter-character space when composing lines at large character sizes. When composing lines at small character sizes, hinting data is used to ensure that the width of the strokes that make up a character look correct.</p>
          <p>Depending on the context, there are several alternative setting methods used, in addition to solid setting, as described below.</p>
          <ul>
          <li><span class="leadin">Increasing inter-character spacing.</span> It is common in books to increase the space between each character frame for the following cases:
<ul>
  <li>To achieve a balance between running heads with different numbers of characters. Increased inter-character spacing is used for running heads with few characters.</li>
  <li>For captions of illustrations and tables, which only have a few characters. Increased inter-character spacing is used to balance with the size of an illustration or table.</li>
  <li>In some cases, increased inter-character spacing is used for poetry where one line has only a few characters, so as to maintain the balance of the layout.</li>
  <li>For publications whose main audience is children, inter-character spacing is increased to make it easier for the children to read.</li>
</ul>
          		</li>
          <li><span class="leadin">Even inter-character spacing.</span> Text may be set with equal inter-character spacing between characters on a given line, so that each line is aligned to the same line head and line end. Since the Chinese characters and punctuation marks are all in square shapes with almost the same dimensions, it is naturally that each line is aligned to the same line head and line end. Even inter-character spacing is mainly used in the following cases:
<ul>
  <li>To deal with rules that forbid certain characters at the beginning or end of a line. When a punctuation marks which is not supposed to be positioned at the end of a line happens to appear there, even inter-character space setting is used to move the character before the punctuation mark to the next line together with the punctuation mark. When a punctuation mark which is not supposed to be positioned at the beginning of a line happens to appear there it is necessary to move the last character from the previous line to the beginning of the next line, and there will be one or two (or sometimes more) empty spaces left in the previous line. Even inter-character space setting is used to unify the length of each line and justify them. </li>
  <li> Even inter-character space setting is used when the number of characters in a table head differs from the table content, such as for person names, so as to justify the table. </li>
</ul>
          		</li>
          <li><span class="leadin">Reducing inter-character spacing.</span> By reducing the inter-character spacing, a portion of two character frames overlap each other. This method is mainly used in the following cases:
<ul>
  <li> For characters in headings in magazines or advertisements, reduced inter-character spacing can be used to keep the characters on one line, or it can also be used to achieve a special effect for presentation. </li>
  <li>Since Chinese characters are all square-shaped, this method does not apply to headings and content in books produced by letterpress printing. </li>
</ul>
          </li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Romanization</h2>
        <p>
          Hanyu Pinyin (汉语拼音), the official standard in Mainland China now, uses the Latin alphabet to transcribe the Modern Standard Chinese (Mandarin) pronunciations of Chinese characters. Indicating the pronunciation for all characters of the full text with Hanyu Pinyin is the most common use case in Mainland China. In Taiwan and Hong Kong, the arrangements of the Taiwanese Romanization System for Minnan (台灣閩南語羅馬字), the Romanization System of the Hong Kong Education and Manpower Bureau (教育學院拼音方案) or Romanization systems of other Chinese dialects are similar to that of Hanyu Pinyin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the features of the Latin alphabet, such annotations appear in horizontal writing mode only. Texts for children who are native speakers usually provide reading assistance for each individual character, while texts for those who are learning Chinese as a second language mainly indicate pronunciation for whole words, but occasionally, both of them will have almost the same typesetting. There will be space between the base text in the latter situation, and the ruby characters will have unique requirements such as sentence case, or punctuation marks corresponding to base characters. Early publications using Pinyin are very varied and lack consistency. Both character-based and word-based annotations are quite common. Further description won't be found in this document.

          <h2>Bilingual Annotations</h2>
          <p>
            Bilingual annotations aim to provide a Chinese translation of text in foreign languages or acronyms, or to offer the original text for words that have been translated into Chinese. This is mainly used for proper nouns, titles or those terms whose concepts are difficult to convey after translation. It is commonly found in translated works, mainly in light novels.

          <p>
           Interlinear comments are methods to annotate the meaning of a piece of text fragments or a single word, which is named for its interlinear positioning. It usually lies in the interlinear space and co-exists with the body text. Compared to other annotation methods, i.e. headnotes or footnotes, interlinear comments are more compact and stickier to the body. These kind of comments are often found in ancient books, such as Rouge Inkstone, an early commentator of the novel Dream of the Red Chamber.

      <h2>Usage of Ruby</h2>
      <p>
        Chinese Ruby, also known as interlinear annotation, is a small-sized, supplementary text attached to certain characters or words in the main text. Chinese Ruby is usually set in the interlinear space and aligned to the corresponding annotated base text. In Chinese typesetting, Chinese Ruby is mainly used to indicate pronunciation or meaning.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Indicating the Pronunciation for Chinese characters</h2>
        <p>
          In Chinese, interlinear annotation is most commonly used to indicate the pronunciation of Hanzi, the Chinese characters. Presenting the pronunciation alongside the characters is a great help to beginners, especially to children who are native speakers or to foreigners intending to study Chinese. Therefore, it is rare to annotate isolated Hanzi characters. Instead, phonetic annotations tend to cover the full text. Also, it is not regular practice in Chinese layout to use ruby for pronunciation outside these educational contexts, even for the pronunciation of rarely used characters, although sometimes pronunciation is provided inline, possibly inside brackets.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two major systems, Zhuyin and Romanization, to indicate Chinese pronunciation.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h2>Zhuyin</h2>
          <p>
           The Mandarin Phonetic System (國語注音符號) or Taiwanese Dialect Phonetic System (台灣方言音符號), hereinafter referred to as ‘Zhuyin’, are the systems for phonetic annotation mainly used in Taiwan, while other areas may also include Zhuyin in certain dictionaries or textbooks. In most cases, Zhuyin appears on the right side of its corresponding character (base text). Exceptions are very rare.
          </p>
        </section>

        <h2>Romanization</h2>

      <h2>Overview of Ruby Positioning</h2>

      <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          In vertical writing mode, Zhuyin, Romanization or bilingual annotations are usually placed at the right side of the base text (Hanzi), while interlinear comments are often placed at the left side. </p>

          <p>In horizontal writing mode, Zhuyin can be placed above the base text, but in most cases they are still set to the right side of the base text. On the other hand, Romanization and bilingual annotations can appear both above or below the base text, and the interlinear comments are usually placed at the bottom of the base text.
        </p>
        <p>
          In principle, Zhuyin Phonetic Symbols are of the same size and the number of Zhuyin symbols for one Hanzi is never more than three, which is more manageable. Romanization, however, uses Latin letters whose sizes are proportional, their composed lengths are varied and there shoule be spaces among words. Thus, these two kinds of phonetic annotations differ greatly in positioning.
        </p>
        <p>
         Annotating both Romanization and Zhuyin is a practical method to indicate the reading to the readers who know only one of these systems, as well as helping study of or enquiries about the other one. Normally, when Romanization and Zhuyin are both provided, the Zhuyin are placed on the right side of the Hanzi, while Romanization is set to the bottom of the Hanzi in horizontal writing mode and to the left side in vertical writing mode.

        <h2>Positioning of Zhuyin Ruby</h2>
        <section>
          <h2>Positioning of Zhuyin Symbols</h2>
          <p>
            According to the Manual of Mandarin Phonetic Symbols (國語注音符號手冊) released by the Ministry of Education in Taiwan, there are two standard ways of placing Zhuyin: above the corresponding Hanzi (horizontal Zhuyin), or on the right side of the corresponding Hanzi (vertical Zhuyin). The use cases for putting Zhuyin above the base characters are rarely found in today's textbooks or other publications, It is hard for the public to accept as well. Therefore, it's always better practice to place Zhuyin annotations on the right side of their corresponding Hanzi, whether in horizontal or vertical writing mode.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Choice of Size and Ratio for Zhuyin Symbols</h2>
          <p>
            Considering a Hanzi character a square with an aspect ratio of 30:30, the ratio of width to height of its Zhuyin annotation will be set as 15:30. The Zhuyin annotation should stay adjacent to its corresponding base character.
          </p>
          <p>
           The aspect ratio of initials, medials and finals is 9:9, while that of Mandarin non-neutral tones and dialect non-checked tones is 5:5, that of Mandarin neutral tones is 9:2, and that of dialect checked tones is 5:5. More details and figures can be found in The Positioning of Different Composition for the Tones below.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the font size of the body is relatively small, it's possible to provide a larger font size for the Zhuyin rather than using the default ratio listed above. Alternatively, other methods, such as bracketing Zhuyin inline, are acceptable. 
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Positioning of the Tones in Zhuyin Symbols</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Mandarin non-neutral tones and dialect non-checked tones, are placed by the upper right corner of the last phonetic symbol.</li>
            <li>The Mandarin neutral tone comes before the phonetic symbols.</li>
            <li>The dialect checked tones are set alongside the lower right corner of the phonetic symbols.</li>

        <section>
          <h2>Line Prohibition Rules for Zhuyin</h2>
          <p>
            Like the line prohibition rules for punctuation, vertical Zhuyin annotations should stick to their base characters in horizontal writing mode. They must not appear in line head, and must be placed on the right side of their corresponding Hanzi.

        <h2>Positioning of Romanization Ruby</h2>
        <section>
          <h2>Basic Requirements</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Romanization is only available in horizontal writing mode. These phonetic annotations are usually placed on top of the base text. In general, phonetic annotations and their base text stick to each other regardless of space, and both of them are centered-aligned.</li>
            <li>In special cases where Romanization is needed in vertical writing mode, the annotations are usually set to the right side of their corresponding base text, but it is difficult to read anyway.</li>
            <li>If a Romanization annotation is longer than its base text and is at the line head or end, both the annotation and the base text can be aligned to the beginning of the line head or end.</li>
            <li>The space between two adjacent annotations should not be smaller than the size of a normal Western-language space, which is about 1/4 em. Due to the limitation of the typesetting technologies, there's usually no space between the rather long phonetic annotations in many printed publications. Luckily, this is not likely to lead to ambiguity because each Hanzi contains one syllable and most Pinyin fragments are easy to tell apart. However, these annotations can be misleading sometimes. For example, character-based phonetic annotations may result in the false impression that they are word-based. Also, the accidental adhered annotations would disrupt the word boundaries, which differs the semantic meanings of the words.</li>
            <p>Note: This layout requirement relies on the way HTML Ruby Markup Extensions supports <rt> and the way CSS Ruby Module Level 1 deals with space. <ruby><rb>双</rb><rb>窗</rb><rt>shuāng</rt> <rt>chuāng</rt></ruby></p>
            <p>Note: The end of the bottom line and the beginner of the head line usually contains a space.</p>
            <li>The annotations are allowed to be extended to the top of adjacent base text as long as the minimum spacing is insured. </li>
            <li>As most target readers are beginners to Chinese, the body text is usually in larger sizes and in Kai typeface.</li>
            <li>Due to the fact that Latin letters are proportional (width unknown) and their advances of different typefaces deviate greatly from one another, the relation between the sizes of annotations and their base text is somehow undetermined. Under the influence of the typesetting of Japanese furigana, however, annotations are usually of half size of the base text.</li>
            <li>
              Annotations usually use a sans-serif typeface which is rather thin and plump.  It is generally the opinion in publishing and in education that Hanyu Pinyin must use those typefaces in which ‘a’ and ‘g’ are single story and the second-tone mark is thick on the lower part and thin on the upper, as in the handwriting style of the stroke. Actually there have never been any national standards specifying the typefaces and the glyphs for Hanyu Pinyin. 
            </li>
            <li>The General Association of Chinese Culture in Taiwan once wrote to the Ministry of Education in Mainland China about the rules for the glyph issue of Hanyu Pinyin, and received the response that the glyphs of the letter ‘a’ and ‘g’ correspond to those of Latin. There is no such requirement demanding the handwritten glyphs.</li>

          <h2>Characters as the Basic Units for Annotating Pronunciation</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The base text is a single Hanzi. Only Hanzi is annotated, excluding European numerals or punctuation marks.</li>
            <li>he phonetic annotations are always on the top.</li>
            <li>As the phonetic annotations are often wider than their base text, the tracking of the body text should be larger for annotations to expand and to avoid irregular adjustments within the base text.</li>
            <li>The phonetic annotations are all in lowercase. Sentence case is rare.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Words as the Basic Units for Annotating Pronunciation</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The base text contains one or more Hanzi. Rules for seperating terms can be found in GB/T 16159—2012 Basic Rules of Hanyu Pinyin Orthography.</li>
            <li>Annotations sometimes appear at the bottom.</li>
            <li>Both the phonetic annotations and the base text are separated by words. The adjacent annotations are seperated by a space approx. 1/2 em, while the tracking inside the base text is usually normal.</li>
            <li>Many word-based annotations indicate the logic of the whole sentence, rather than merely the pronunciation: these phonetic annotations have sentence case, as well as punctuation marks which follow the previous annotations.</li>

        <h2>Atypical Cases for Hanzi Phonetic Annotations</h2>
        <section>
          <h2>Erhuayin </h2>
          <p>
            Erhuayin, a.k.a. rhotacization of syllable finals, is one special phonetic phenomenon in Modern Standard Chinese (Mandarin). Due to the limitation of annotating single Hanzi, the Zhuyin annotations fails to indicate the continuity of Erhuayin and the change of the final, while Romanization shows the features of Erhuayin effectively.

          <h2>Ligatures</h2>
          <p>
            Ligature is special for its multisyllabic feature, thus its ruby annotation may fail to typeset properly. The reading of ligatures should be bracketed inline or given in notes instead. Ligature is rare nowadays in the modern Chinese writing system.

        <h2>Positioning of Bilingual Annotations</h2>
        <p>
         The typesetting of bilingual annotations is actually quite similar to that of Romanization. Annotations are usually placed at the top side of the annotated text — the right side of the base text in vertical writing mode or on top of the base text in horizontal writing mode.

          <h2>Word Alignment</h2>
          <p>In order to maintain the unity of terms, while the lengths of annotations and their base text are different, it is necessary to adjust the alignment between them to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
          <p>When the length of one annotation is shorter than that of its base text, the annotation can be aligned centered (applied to Western script) or use a larger tracking (applied to Hanzi). There are two methods to satisfy the latter, one is to equally distribute the spacing while the other is to align justified.</p>
          <p>When the length of one annotation is longer than that of its base text, the base text can be aligned centered (applied to Western script) or use a larger tracking (applied to Hanzi).</p>

        <h2>Positioning of Interlinear Comments</h2>
        <p>Interlinear comments can have very varied layouts and lengths. They are usually placed in the foot side of the annotated text — the left side of the base text in vertical writing mode or the bottom of the base text in horizontal writing mode. Sometimes the interlinear comments are in other colors to help reader tell the difference from the body text.</p>
