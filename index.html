      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Each cultural community has its own language, script and writing system. The transfer of each writing system into cyberspace is a task with very high importance for information and communication technology.</p>

    <h3>How This Document Was Created</h3>
    <p>Chinese composition exhibits several differences from other writing systems. The major features include: </p>
    <ul>
          <li> There are two written scripts in Chinese, using traditional and simplified characters. Apart from the differences between glyphs and strokes, the composition rules can be different as well.</li>
          <li> There are two writing modes: vertical and horizontal. The former is often seen in Traditional Chinese publications.</li>
          <li> In principal, the characters, including Chinese (hanzi) characters and punctuation, used in Chinese composition are squares with the ratio of 1:1, and are seamlessly arranged with one another.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>This document mainly adopts the following policies to explain the features of Chinese composition:</p>
    <ul>
          <li> It does not fully cover all details of the Chinese composition system, but mainly describes the differences from Western composition systems.</li>
          <li> It explains in detail the similarities and differences between traditional and simplified Chinese composition.</li>
          <li> It describes features of Chinese composition that differ from those mentioned in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/">Requirements for Japanese Text Layout</a>.</li>
          <li> It describes presentational results and considers these results as issues and requirements for Chinese text layout. Meanwhile, it offers principles or methods for for handling these issues, without describing particular technological solutions.</li>
          <li> It suggests solutions for, or explains, present-day issues that people face in Chinese composition.</li>
          <li> It provides typical instances of Chinese composition and their actual use cases as much as possible.</li>
          <li> In consideration of non-Chinese readers of this document, figures are used for explanation wherever possible.</li>
          <li> It mainly explains modern Chinese publications. Looking back to the publications in the time of movable type, there may be some differences, but they are still considered part of Chinese composition. The document does not yet fully cover ancient books. Future editions may be revised with such features in mind.</li>
          <li> For non-Chinese readers, frequency of use is indicated for each requirement. These frequencies are not the outcome of any accurate research, but arise from the long experience of the authors. Non-Chinese readers should understand that they are intuitive for ordinary Chinese readers. These frequencies provide only rough information to prioritize the importance of issues.</li>
          <li> The main target of this document is common books. Other publications, such as magazines or newspapers, are also included.</li>

      <h2>Basics of Chinese Composition</h2>
      <section>
    <h3>Characters Used for Chinese Composition</h3>
    <section>
          <h4>Characters Used for Chinese Composition</h4>
          <p>It is mainly Chinese (hanzi) characters that are used for Chinese composition. </p>
          <p>Chinese characters include Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese alternatives. The former is commonly used in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao while the latter is commonly used in Mainland China, Singapore and Malaysia. In this document, the number of strokes and the compositional nature of a character are considered to be the major differences between Simplified Chinese characters and Traditional Chinese characters. </p>
          <p>Different typefaces are used different in regions. The presentational aspects of typefaces do not have a relationship to Unicode, but rather depend on the operating system and the character library. The focus of this document is Chinese composition and we will not discuss typeface presentation. </p>
          <p class="note">In addition to the Chinese (hanzi) characters, various punctuation marks, as well as Western characters such as Arabic numerals, Latin letters and/or Greek letters, may be used in Chinese text. </p>
          <p class="note">One Simplified Chinese character may have more than one corresponding traditional form. For example, the Simplified Chinese character 发 can be matched to either the Traditional Chinese character 發 or 髮, depending on the context. </p>
        </section>
    <section>
          <h4>Chinese Characters</h4>
          <p>Chinese characters have square <dfn>character frames</dfn> of equal dimensions. Aligned with the vertical and horizontal center of the character frame, there is a smaller box called the <dfn>letter face</dfn>, which contains the actual symbol. (There should be some space left between the letter face and the frame). Most of the punctuation marks for Chinese characters share the same size as the other characters, however some of them differ, such as the ellipsis, which is one-character high and two-characters wide.</p>
          <p>Character size is measured by the size of the character frame. <dfn>Character advance</dfn> is a term used to describe the advance width of the character frame of a character. The frame of a Chinese character should be a square. </p>
        </section>
    <section>
          <h4>Principles for Arranging Characters during Chinese Composition</h4>
          <p>In principle, when composing a line with Chinese characters, no extra space appears between their character frames. This is called <dfn>solid setting</dfn>. </p>
          <p class="note">Unlike the letterpress printing era, when several sizes of the original pattern of a letter were required to create matrices, in today's digital era the same original pattern is used for any size simply by enlargement or reduction. Because of this, it might be necessary to adjust the inter-character space when composing lines at large character sizes. When composing lines at small character sizes, hinting data is used to ensure that the width of the strokes that make up a character look correct.</p>
          <p>Depending on the context, there are several alternative setting methods used, in addition to solid setting, as described below.</p>
          <ul>
        <li><span class="leadin">Increasing inter-character spacing.</span> It is common in books to increase the space between each character frame for the following cases:
              <ul>
            <li>To achieve a balance between running heads with different numbers of characters. Increased inter-character spacing is used for running heads with few characters.</li>
            <li>For captions of illustrations and tables, which only have a few characters. Increased inter-character spacing is used to balance with the size of an illustration or table.</li>
            <li>In some cases, increased inter-character spacing is used for poetry where one line has only a few characters, so as to maintain the balance of the layout.</li>
            <li>For publications whose main audience is children, inter-character spacing is increased to make it easier for the children to read.</li>
          </ul>
            </li>
        <li><span class="leadin">Even inter-character spacing.</span> Text may be set with equal inter-character spacing between characters on a given line, so that each line is aligned to the same line head and line end. Since the Chinese characters and punctuation marks are all in square shapes with almost the same dimensions, it is naturally that each line is aligned to the same line head and line end. Even inter-character spacing is mainly used in the following cases:
              <ul>
            <li>To deal with rules that forbid certain characters at the beginning or end of a line. When a punctuation marks which is not supposed to be positioned at the end of a line happens to appear there, even inter-character space setting is used to move the character before the punctuation mark to the next line together with the punctuation mark. When a punctuation mark which is not supposed to be positioned at the beginning of a line happens to appear there it is necessary to move the last character from the previous line to the beginning of the next line, and there will be one or two (or sometimes more) empty spaces left in the previous line. Even inter-character space setting is used to unify the length of each line and justify them. </li>
            <li> Even inter-character space setting is used when the number of characters in a table head differs from the table content, such as for person names, so as to justify the table. </li>
          </ul>
            </li>
        <li><span class="leadin">Reducing inter-character spacing.</span> By reducing the inter-character spacing, a portion of two character frames overlap each other. This method is mainly used in the following cases:
              <ul>
            <li> For characters in headings in magazines or advertisements, reduced inter-character spacing can be used to keep the characters on one line, or it can also be used to achieve a special effect for presentation. </li>
            <li>Since Chinese characters are all square-shaped, this method does not apply to headings and content in books produced by letterpress printing. </li>
          </ul>
            </li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Typefaces for Chinese Characters</h3>
    <section>
          <h4>Four Frequently-used Typefaces for Chinese Characters <span class="ednote">I'm inclined to think that a heading is superfluous here.</span></h4>
          <p>There are four main typefaces in use for Chinese characters: Song, Hei, Kai and Fangsong (Imitation Song). The common practice for these four typefaces will be presented in corresponding use of contexts. </p>
        </section>
    <section>
          <h4>Song/Ming</h4>
          <figure>
        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="zh/images/hei.png" alt="Picture of Song Type" style="width: 80%"/></p>
        <figcaption>Song</figcaption>
      </figure>
          <p><dfn>Song</dfn>, also known as Songti or Ming, is a category of typefaces used to display Chinese characters and currently the most common style of type in print for Chinese. In Mainland China, the most common name is Song while in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and Korea, Ming is prevalent. </p>
          <p>Song is commonly used in text, headings and annotations. When used in headings, the characters will appear in a bold face, so as to distinguish the heading from the text. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
          <h4>Kai</h4>
          <figure>
        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="zh/images/kai.png" alt="Picture of Song Type" style="width: 80%"/></p>
        <figcaption>Song</figcaption>
      </figure>
          <p><dfn>Kai</dfn>, also known as Kaiti or regular script, is another of the major typefaces, and provides calligraphic styles for Chinese characters. It is also the most easily and widely recognized style and shows notable handwriting features. </p>
          <p>Kai is mainly used in text that needs to be differentiated from the rest of the content, for example, headlines, references, quotations, and dialogs. It is rarely used for emphasis, because of its similarity with Song. </p>
          <p class="note">Since Kai retains some calligraphic features, it is widely used in office documents and the textbooks. </p>
        </section>
    <section>
          <h4>Hei</h4>
          <figure>
        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="zh/images/hei.png" alt="Picture of Hei Type" style="width: 80%"/></p>
        <figcaption>Hei</figcaption>
      </figure>
          <p><dfn>Hei</dfn>, also known as Heiti or Gothic, is a type style characterized by strokes of even thickness, reduced curves, and a lack of decoration. It is commonly used in headlines, signs, and personal names in dialogs. For certain types of text, characters in Kai style with thicker strokes typically indicate emphasis. </p>
          <p>Traditional publications rarely apply the Hei style for content, but with the growing influence of the World Wide Web and the digital publishing industry, some publications are starting to experiment Hei in this context.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
          <h4>Fangsong (Imitation Song)</h4>
          <figure>
        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="zh/images/fangsong.png" alt="Picture of Song Type" style="width: 80%"/></p>
        <figcaption>FangSong (Imitation Song)</figcaption>
      </figure>
          <p>The <dfn>Fangsong</dfn> (Imitation Song) style lies between Song and Kai. It is commonly used in isolated paragraphs such as quotations or highlighted sentences.</p>

    <h3>Page format</h3>
    <section>
          <h4>Basic Elements of Layout</h4>
          <p>The <dfn>type area</dfn> <span class="ednote">reminder: double check this terminology</span>, sometimes called printing area, is designed in the following sequence. </p>
          <ul>
            <li> First, prepare a template of the page format, which determines the basic appearance of document pages.</li>
            <li> Then, specify the details of actual page elements based on the template.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Books usually use one basic template for page format, whereas magazines often use several templates.</p>
          <p>Although in books, there tends to be one template for the page format, some further design effort based around the basic page format will be needed for pages such as the table of contents and indexes. Furthermore, there are many examples of indexes with a different page format than the basic page format, and vertically set books often have indexes in horizontal writing mode, and sometimes multiple columns. However, while doing actual design for the page, the size of the type area should not exceed the basic page template.<span class="ednote"> (have some doubts about the translation of 版面 here)</span>. </p>
          <p>Magazines usually contain various kinds of content, which naturally leads to various designs of templates, different sizes of characters, and varying numbers of columns. </p>

  <h2>Line composition</h2>
      <section>
    <h3>Composition of Chinese and Western Mixed Texts</h3>
    <p>In Chinese text there are plenty of situations where Western characters, such as Latin letters, Greek letters, or Arabic numerals, are found alongside Hanzi. The following are just a few examples:</p>
    <ul>
          <li> One Western letter is used as a symbol for something, such as 'A' or 'B'.</li>
          <li>A Western word is used in a Chinese context, such as 'editor'.</li>
          <li>Acronyms, such as 'DTP' or 'GDP'.</li>
          <li> Book titles or authors in references to Western books that use the original spelling.</li>
          <li> Arabic numerals used in xxxx, xxxx, or xxxx, such as '1999'.<span class="ednote"> (? used to represent years, quantities or xxx)</span></li>
        </ul>
    <p>Western characters are also found in contexts such as numerals in itemized lists and numbered headings, or symbols for chemical elements or mathematical formulae. It can be seen from these examples that it is an everyday occurrence to find Western characters mixed with Hanzi in Chinese composition.</p>
    <p>Formerly, fullwidth ASCII characters were often used, either to make the presentation look orderly, or simply due to the poorly developed computer technologies available for text layout. Nowadays, typesetting engines allow for proportional or monospace fonts, as required, rather than forcing the user to resort to the old  fullwidth blocks of Latin letters and Arabic numerals.</p>
    <p>When western texts mixed with Hanzi, Chinese style punctuation and its common usage should be used on principle since the main text is Chinese,  However, in case of technical documents, if plenty of formula are contained into the text, full stop can be unified with western-style period [.] as full stop. Also in text books on grammar of Western languages etc., since plenty of example sentences are contained and mixed with Chinese, western-style period can be used.</p>
  </section>
      <section>
    <h3>Mixed Text Composition in Horizontal Writing Mode</h3>
    <p>In horizontal writing mode, the basic approach uses proportional fonts to represent Western text and uses proportional or monospace fonts for Arabic numerals. In principle, there is tracking or spacing between an adjacent Hanzi and Western character of up to one quarter of a Hanzi character width, except at the line head or end.</p>
    <p>Another approach is the use a Western word space (U+0020 SPACE), in which case the width depends on the font in use. <span class="ednote">This sentence was translated from a note in Hackpad.</span></p>
  </section>
      <section>
    <h3>Mixed Text Composition in Vertical Writing Mode</h3>
    <p>For vertical writing mode, the following list describes methods of setting Western letters and Arabic numerals:</p>
    <p> Setting Western letters with Hanzi-width monospace fonts. Letters or Arabic numeral follow each other, one at a time, in the same direction and rotation as the Hanzi characters.  This arrangement is usually adopted where the text contains a single letter or digit, or an acronym.</p>
    <p> Setting Western letters with proportional fonts, rotated 90 degrees clockwise.  This approach is usually adopted where Latin letters compose a word or sentence. There is tracking or spacing between a Hanzi character and an adjacent Western letter or Arabic numeral, up to a width of one quarter of a Hanzi character, except at the line head or end.</p>
    <p> Setting Arabic numerals with proportional fonts in horizontal-in-vertical orientation. This style is usually adopted when dealing with a two to three digit number whose width is equal to the default line advance or slightly wider (within an acceptable range).</p>
    <p> Note: Hanzi numerals are usually used in vertical writing mode, however in recent years it is becoming more common to see fullwidth Arabic numerals and proportional numerals set as horizontal-in-vertical.</p>
  </section>
      <section>
    <h3>Handling Western Text in Chinese Text Using Proportional Western Fonts</h3>
    <p>The following provides composition rules for handling Western characters and Arabic numerals in horizontal writing mode or in situations in vertical writing mode where the Western words/phrases or Arabic numerals are rotated 90 degrees clockwise:</p>
    <ul>
          <li> A sequence of Western characters in a Western word should not break across a line-break, except where hyphenation is allowed.</li>
          <li> Tracking or spacing between a Hanzi character and a Western letter or numeral is up to a quarter of the width of a Hanzi character.</li>
          <li> Justified text alignment is an important feature of Chinese composition. It is harder to align text as expected with a line contains Western characters. Typically, spacing or tracking is applied equally across the line, but such adjustments only applied between Hanzi characters or between Hanzi and Western letters.  The spacing is not equally distributed between Western words and/or Arabic numerals.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Exceptions are made in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
          <li> Tracking or spacing of Western letters or Arabic numerals before the line head or after the line end are not justified.</li>
          <li> Tracking or spacing of Western letters or Arabic numerals is not adjusted  before or after Chinese commas or full stops, nor after Chinese opening and before Chinese closing brackets.</li>
        </ul>
  </section>
      <section>
    <h3>Handling of Criss-cross [Grid?] Alignment in Chinese and Western Mixed Text Composition</h3>
    <p>Due to the fact that each Hanzi character is of the same width, xxxx, it is also a requirement for blocks of Hanzi text to be aligned both vertically and horizontally, whether in vertical or horizontal writing mode.  When Western text or Arabic numerals intervene, this principle is harder to achieve. Possible approaches are listed below:</p>
    <ul>
          <li> Instead of a quarter Hanzi-width tracking between Hanzi and Western letters, it is possible to use flexible spacing of up to half a Hanzi character width.  This brings the space occupied by Western characters to a multiple of the width of a Hanzi character. In this way, both the Hanzi character before and after the Western language span snaps to the grid lines.</li>
          <li> When a Western word appears at the line end and needs to be broken, rather than breaking the word at a syllable boundary per the Western convention, the word may be forced to break at the line end, in order to ensure correct alignment.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Ruby</h2>
      <section>
    <h3>Usage of ruby</h3>
    <p>Chinese Ruby, also known as Interlinear Annotation, is small, supplementary text attached to certain characters or words in the main text. Chinese ruby is usually set in the interlinear space and aligned to the corresponding base text which it annotates. In Chinese typesetting, Chinese ruby is mainly used to indicate pronunciation or meaning.</p>
    <section>
      <h4>Indicating the Pronunciation for Chinese characters.</h4>
          <p>In Chinese, interlinear annotation is most commonly used to indicate the pronunciation of Hanzi, the Chinese characters. Presenting the pronunciation alongside the characters is a great help to beginners, especially to children who are native speakers, or to foreigners intending to study Chinese. Therefore, it is rare to annotate isolated Hanzi characters. Instead, phonetic annotations tend to cover the full text. Also, it is not regular practice in Chinese layout to use ruby for pronunciation outside these educational contexts, even for the pronunciation of rarely used characters, although sometimes pronunciation is provided inline, possibly inside brackets.</p>
          <figure>
        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="zh/images/inline-bopomofo.gif" alt="Inline bopomofo" /></p>
      </figure>
          <p>There are two major annotation systems for indicating Chinese pronunciation: Zhuyin and Romanization.</p>
          <ul>
        <li><span class="leadin">Zhuyin.</span> Mandarin Phonetic Symbols (國語注音符號) or Taiwanese Dialect Phonetic Symbols (台灣方言音符號), hereinafter referred to as ‘Zhuyin’, are systems for phonetic annotation mainly used in Taiwan, although other areas may also include Zhuyin in certain dictionaries or textbooks. In most cases, Zhuyin appears on the right side of its corresponding base text. Exceptions are very rare.</li>
        <li><span class="leadin">Romanization.</span> Hanyu Pinyin (汉语拼音), now the official standard in Mainland China, uses the Latin alphabet to transcribe the Modern Standard Chinese (Mandarin) pronunciations of Chinese characters. The most common use case in Mainland China is to indicate the pronunciation for all characters of the full text with Hanyu Pinyin. In Taiwan and Hong Kong, the arrangement of the Taiwanese Romanization System for Minnan (台灣閩南語羅馬字), the Romanization System of the Hong Kong Education and Manpower Bureau (教育學院拼音方案) or romanization systems of other Chinese dialects are similar to those of Hanyu Pinyin.
              <p>Due to the characteristics of the Latin alphabet, such annotations appear in horizontal writing mode only. Texts for children who are native speakers usually provide reading assistance for each individual character, while texts for those who are learning Chinese as a second language mainly indicate pronunciation for whole words, but occasionally, both of them are set almost the same. There is space between the base text when whole words are annotated, and the ruby characters will have unique requirements such as sentence case, or punctuation marks corresponding to base characters. Early publications using Pinyin are very varied and lack consistency. Both character-based and word-based annotations are quite common. No further description of the early pinyin will be found in this document.</p>

        <li><span class="leadin">Bilingual Annotations.</span> Bilingual annotations aim to provide a Chinese translation of text in foreign languages or acronyms, or to offer the original text for words that have been translated into Chinese. This is mainly used for proper nouns, titles or those terms whose concepts are difficult to convey after translation. It is commonly found in translated works, mainly in light novels.</li>
        <li> <span class="leadin">Interlinear Comments (TBC).</span>&nbsp;     Interlinear comments are ways to annotate the meaning of text fragments or a single word, and are so named for their interlinear positioning. They usually lie in the interlinear space and co-exist with the body text. Compared to other annotation methods, i.e. headnotes or footnotes, interlinear comments are more compact and stick better to the body. These kinds of comments are often found in ancient books, such as Rouge Inkstone, an early commentary of the novel Dream of the Red Chamber.</li>

    <h3>Overview of Ruby Positioning</h3>
    <p>In vertical writing mode, Zhuyin, Romanization or bilingual annotations are usually placed on the right side of the base text (Hanzi), while interlinear comments are often placed on the left side.</p>
    <p>In horizontal writing mode, Zhuyin can be placed above the base text, but in most cases they are still set to the right side of the base text. On the other hand, Romanization and bilingual annotations can appear both above or below the base text, and the interlinear comments are usually placed at the bottom of the base text.</p>
    <p>In principle, Zhuyin Phonetic Symbols are of the same size, and the number of Zhuyin symbols for one Hanzi is never more than three, which is quite easily manageable. Romanization, however, uses Latin letters whose sizes are proportional, their composed lengths are varied and there should be spaces between the words. Thus, these two kinds of phonetic annotations differ greatly in positioning.</p>
    <p>Annotating with both Romanization and Zhuyin is a practical way to indicate the reading to readers who know only one of these systems, as well as helping study of or enquiries about the other one. Normally, when Romanization and Zhuyin are both provided, the Zhuyin are placed on the right side of the Hanzi while Romanization is set at the bottom of the Hanzi in horizontal writing mode and to the left side in vertical writing mode.</p>

      <h4>Positioning of Zhuyin Symbols.</h4>
          <p> According to the <cite>Manual of Mandarin Phonetic Symbols</cite> (國語注音符號手冊) released by the Ministry of Education in Taiwan, there are two standard ways of positioning Zhuyin: above the corresponding Hanzi (horizontal Zhuyin), or on the right side of the corresponding Hanzi (vertical Zhuyin). The use cases for putting Zhuyin above the base characters are rarely found in today's textbooks or other publications, and it is rarely used by the public at large. Therefore, it's always better practice to place Zhuyin annotations on the right side of their corresponding Hanzi, whether in horizontal or vertical writing mode.</p>
        </section>
    <section>
          <h4>Choice of Size and Ratio for Zhuyin Symbols.</h4>
          <ol>
        <li>Considering a Hanzi character a square with an aspect ratio of 30:30, the ratio of width to height of its Zhuyin annotation will be set as 15:30. The Zhuyin annotation should stay adjacent to its corresponding base character.</li>
        <li>The aspect ratio of initials, medials and finals is 9:9, while that of Mandarin non-neutral tones and dialect non-checked tones is 5:5, that of Mandarin neutral tones is 9:2, and that of dialectal checked tones is 5:5. More details and figures can be found in  Positioning of Different Composition for the Tones below.</li>
        <li> When the font size of the body is relatively small, it's possible to provide a larger font size for the Zhuyin rather than using the default ratio listed above. Alternatively, other methods, such as bracketing Zhuyin inline, are acceptable.</li>

          <h4>Line Prohibition Rules for Zhuyin</h4>
          <p>Like the line prohibition rules for punctuation, vertical Zhuyin annotations should stick to their base characters in horizontal writing mode. They must not appear in the line head, and must be placed on the right side of their corresponding Hanzi.</p>

    <section>
          <h4>Basic Requirements</h4>
          <ol>
        <li> Romanization is only available in horizontal writing mode. These phonetic annotations are usually placed on top of the base text. In general, phonetic annotations and their base text stick to each other regardless of space, and both of them are centered-aligned.</li>
        <li> In special cases where Romanization is needed in vertical writing mode, the annotations are usually set to the right side of their corresponding base text, but it is difficult to read anyway.</li>
        <li> If a Romanized annotation is longer than its base text and is at the line head or end, both the annotation and the base text can be aligned to the beginning of the line head or end.</li>
        <li> The space between two adjacent annotations should not be smaller than the size of a normal Western-language space, which is about 1/4 em. Due to the limitation of the typesetting technologies, there is usually no space between the rather long phonetic annotations in many printed publications. Luckily, this is not likely to lead to ambiguity because each Hanzi contains one syllable and most Pinyin fragments are easy to tell apart. However, these annotations can be misleading sometimes. For example, character-based phonetic annotations may result in the false impression that they are word-based. Also, the accidentally concatenated annotations may disrupt word boundaries, which alters the semantic meanings of the words.</li>
        <li> Annotations are allowed to extend to the top of adjacent base text as long as the minimum spacing is ensured. </li>
        <li> As most target readers are beginners to Chinese, the body text is usually in larger sizes and in the Kai typeface.</li>
        <li> Due to the fact that Latin letters are proportional (width unknown) and that the advance widths in different typefaces deviate greatly from one another, the relationship between the sizes of annotations and their base text is somewhat undetermined. Under the influence of the typesetting of Japanese furigana, however, annotations are usually of half size of the base text.</li>
        <li> Annotations usually use a sans-serif typeface which is rather thin and plump.  It is generally the opinion in publishing and in education that Hanyu Pinyin must use those typefaces in which ‘a’ and ‘g’ are single story and the second tone mark is thick on the lower part and thin on the upper, as in the handwritten style of the stroke. Actually there have never been any national standards specifying the typefaces and the glyphs for Hanyu Pinyin. </li>
        <li> The General Association of Chinese Culture in Taiwan once wrote to the Ministry of Education in Mainland China about the rules for the glyphs of Hanyu Pinyin, and received the response that the glyphs of the letter ‘a’ and ‘g’ correspond to those of Latin. There is no requirement demanding the handwritten glyphs.</li>

          <h4> Characters as the Basic Units for Annotating Pronunciation</h4>
          <ol>
        <li> The base text is a single Hanzi. Only Hanzi is annotated: European numerals or punctuation marks are excluded.</li>
        <li> The phonetic annotations are always on the top.</li>
        <li> As the phonetic annotations are often wider than their base text, the tracking of the body text should be larger, to allow annotations to expand and to avoid irregular adjustments within the base text.</li>
        <li> The phonetic annotations are all in lowercase. Sentence case is rare.</li>

    <section>
          <h4> Words as the Basic Units for Annotating Pronunciation</h4>
          <ol>
        <li> The base text contains one or more Hanzi. Rules for separating terms can be found in <cite>GB/T 16159—2012 Basic Rules of Hanyu Pinyin Orthography</cite>.</li>
        <li> Annotations sometimes appear below the Han characters.</li>
        <li> Both the phonetic annotations and the base text are separated at word boundaries. The adjacent annotations are separated by a space approximately 1/2 em wide, while the tracking inside the base text is usually normal.</li>
        <li> Many word-based annotations indicate the logic of the whole sentence, rather than merely the pronunciation: these phonetic annotations have sentence case, as well as punctuation marks which follow the previous annotations.</li>

          <h4>Erhuayin</h4>
          <p> Erhuayin, also known as rhotacization of syllable finals, is a special phonetic phenomenon in Modern Standard Chinese (Mandarin). Due to the limitations of annotating single Hanzi, the Zhuyin annotations fail to indicate the continuity of Erhuayin and the change of the final sound, while Romanization shows the features of Erhuayin effectively.</p>
        </section>
    <section>
          <h4>Ligatures</h4>
          <p> Ligatures are special for their multisyllabic nature, thus its ruby annotation may be typeset incorrectly. The pronunciation of ligatures should be bracketed inline or given in notes instead. Ligatures are rare in the modern Chinese writing system.</p>

    <h3 id="h-positioning_of_bilingual_annotations">Positioning of Bilingual Annotations</h3>
    <p>Typesetting of bilingual annotations is actually quite similar to that of Romanization. Annotations are usually placed to the right of the base text in vertical writing mode, or above the base text in horizontal writing mode.</p>
    <section>
          <h4> Word Alignment</h4>
          <p> In order to maintain the integrity of annotations, when the lengths of annotations and their base text are different it is  necessary to adjust the alignment between them to avoid  misunderstandings.</p>
          <ol>
        <li> When  the length of an annotation is shorter than that of its base text, the  annotation can be center-aligned (in the case of Western script) or use larger tracking (in the case of Hanzi). There are two methods to satisfy  the latter, one is to equally distribute the spacing while the other is  to align justified.</li>
        <li> When  the length of an annotation is longer than that of its base text, the  base text can be center-aligned  (in the case of Western script) or use a  larger tracking (in the case of Hanzi).</li>

    <h3 id="h-positioning_of_interlinear_comments">Positioning of Interlinear Comments</h3>
    <p>Interlinear comments can have very varied layouts and lengths. They are usually placed at the foot side of the annotated text — to the left side of the base text in vertical writing mode or  below the base text in horizontal writing mode. Sometimes the interlinear comments are in other colors to help the reader tell the  difference from the body text .</p>
    <p>Interlinear comments are also used to explain the context and details of a longer text fragment. In such cases, due to the ambiguity of the base text, the annotation can find a suitable place as an anchor and flow down. There's no strict requirement for its length, and sometimes it can be longer than one line.</p>
