    <h3 id="h-purpose_of_this_document">Purpose of this document</h3>
    <p>Each cultural community has its own language, script and writing system. The transfer of each writing system into cyberspace is a task with very high importance for information and communication technology.</p>
    <p>As one of the basic work items of this task force, this document summarizes the text composition requirements in the Chinese writing system. One of the goals of the task force is to describe the issues in Chinese layout requirements, another is to provide satisfactory equivalents to the current standards (i.e. Unicode), and another is to prompt vendors to implement those relevant features correctly.</p>

    <h3 id="h-basic_principles_for_development_of_this_document">How This Document Was Created</h3>
    <p>Chinese composition exhibits several differences from other writing systems. The major features include: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> There are two written scripts in Chinese, using traditional and simplified characters. Apart from the differences between glyphs and strokes, the composition rules can be different as well.</li>
      <li> There are two writing modes: vertical and horizontal. The former is often seen in Traditional Chinese publications.</li>
      <li> In principal, the characters, including Chinese (hanzi) characters and punctuation, used in Chinese composition are squares with the ratio of 1:1, and are seamlessly arranged with one another.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="issue">The remaining English text in this section (ie. what follows) comes from hackpad, but seems to no longer be in the Chinese version. Should it be deleted?</p>
    <p>This document mainly adopts the following policies to explain the features of Chinese composition:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> It does not fully cover all details of the Chinese composition system, but mainly describes the differences from Western composition systems.</li>
      <li> It explains in detail the similarities and differences between traditional and Simplified Chinese composition.</li>
      <li> It describes features of Chinese composition that differ from those mentioned in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/">Requirements for Japanese Text Layout</a>.</li>
      <li> It describes presentational results and considers these results as issues and requirements for Chinese text layout. Meanwhile, it offers principles or methods for for handling these issues, without describing particular technological solutions.</li>
      <li> It suggests solutions for, or explains, present-day issues that people face in Chinese composition.</li>
      <li> It provides typical instances of Chinese composition and their actual use cases as much as possible.</li>
      <li> In consideration of non-Chinese readers of this document, figures are used for explanation wherever possible.</li>
      <li> It mainly explains modern Chinese publications. Looking back to the publications in the time of movable type, there may be some differences, but they are still considered part of Chinese composition. The document does not yet fully cover ancient books. Future editions may be revised with such features in mind.</li>
      <li> For non-Chinese readers, frequency of use is indicated for each requirement. These frequencies are not the outcome of any accurate research, but arise from the long experience of the authors. Non-Chinese readers should understand that they are intuitive for ordinary Chinese readers. These frequencies provide only rough information to prioritize the importance of issues.</li>
      <li> The main target of this document is common books. Other publications, such as magazines or newspapers, are also included.</li>

    <section id="characters_used_in_chinese_composition">
      <h4 id="h-characters_used_in_chinese_composition">Characters used for Chinese composition <span class="issue">remove duplicate heading?</span></h4>
      <p>The majority of the text used in Chinese composition consists of Han characters (hanzi).</p>
      <p>Chinese characters include Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese alternatives. The former is commonly used in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao while the latter is commonly used in Mainland China, Singapore and Malaysia. In this document, the number of strokes and the compositional nature of a character are considered to be the major differences between Simplified Chinese characters and Traditional Chinese characters.</p>
      <p>Different typefaces are used different in regions. The presentational aspects of typefaces do not have a relationship to Unicode, but rather depend on the operating system and the character library. The focus of this document is Chinese composition and we will not discuss typeface presentation. </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>In addition to the Chinese (hanzi) characters, various punctuation marks, as well as Western characters such as European numerals, Latin letters and/or Greek letters, may be used in Chinese text. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="note">
        <p><span  class="issue">This note appears to no longer be in the Chinese translation. Delete?</span> One Simplified Chinese character may have more than one corresponding Traditional form. For example, the Simplified Chinese character 发 can be matched to either the Traditional Chinese character 發 or 髮, depending on the context. </p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="han_characters">
      <h4 id="h-han_characters">Chinese Characters</h4>
      <p>Chinese characters have square <dfn id="def_characterFrame">character frames</dfn> of equal dimensions. Aligned with the vertical and horizontal center of the character frame, there is a smaller box called the <dfn id="def_letterFace">letter face</dfn>, which contains the actual symbol. (There should be some space left between the letter face and the frame). Most of the punctuation marks for Chinese characters share the same size as the other characters, however some of them differ, such as the ellipsis, which is one-character high and two-characters wide.</p>
      <p>Character size is measured by the size of the character frame. <dfn id="def_characterAdvance">Character advance</dfn> is a term used to describe the advance width of the character frame of a character. The frame of a Chinese character should be a square. </p>
    </section>
    <section id="principles_of_arrangement_of_han_characters">
      <h4 id="h-principles_of_arrangement_of_han_characters">Principles for Arranging Characters during Chinese Composition</h4>
      <p>In principle, when composing a line with Chinese characters, no extra space appears between their character frames. This is called <dfn>solid setting</dfn>. </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Unlike the letterpress printing era, when several sizes of the original pattern of a letter were required to create matrices, in today's digital era the same original pattern is used for any size simply by enlargement or reduction. Because of this, it might be necessary to adjust the inter-character space when composing lines at large character sizes. When composing lines at small character sizes, hinting data is used to ensure that the width of the strokes that make up a character look correct.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Depending on the context, in addition to solid setting several alternative setting methods can be used, as described below.</p>
      <section>
        <h5 id="h-increased_inter_character_spacing">Increased inter-character spacing</h5>
        <p> It is common in books to increase the space between each character frame for the following cases:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>To achieve a balance between running heads with different numbers of characters. Increased inter-character spacing is used for running heads with few characters.</li>
          <li>For captions of illustrations and tables, which only have a few characters. Increased inter-character spacing is used to balance with the size of an illustration or table.</li>
          <li>In some cases, increased inter-character spacing is used for poetry where one line has only a few characters, so as to maintain the balance of the layout.</li>
          <li>For publications whose main audience is children, inter-character spacing is increased to make it easier for the children to read.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5 id="h-even_inter_character_spacing">Even inter-character spacing</h5>
        <p>Text may be set with equal inter-character spacing between all characters on a given line, so that each line is aligned to the same line head and line end. Since the Chinese characters and punctuation marks are all in square shapes with almost the same dimensions, it is natural that each line is aligned to the same line head and line end. Even inter-character spacing is mainly used in the following cases:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>To deal with rules that forbid certain characters at the beginning or end of a line. When a punctuation mark which is not supposed to be positioned at the end of a line happens to appear there, even inter-character space setting is used to move the character before the punctuation mark to the next line together with the punctuation mark. When a punctuation mark which is not supposed to be positioned at the beginning of a line happens to appear there it is necessary to move the last character from the previous line to the beginning of the next line, and there will be one or two (or sometimes more) empty spaces left in the previous line. Even inter-character space setting is used to unify the length of each line and justify them. </li>
          <li> Even inter-character space setting is used when the number of characters in a table head differs from the table content, such as for person names, so as to justify the table. </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5 id="h-reduced_inter_character_spacing">Reduced inter-character spacing</h5>
        <p>By reducing the inter-character spacing, a portion of two character frames overlap each other. This method is mainly used in the following cases:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> For characters in headings in magazines or advertisements, reduced inter-character spacing can be used to keep the characters on one line, or it can also be used to achieve a special effect for presentation. </li>
          <li>Since Chinese characters are all square-shaped, this method does not apply to headings and content in books produced by letterpress printing. </li>
        </ol>

    <section id="four_commonly_used_typefaces_for_chinese_composition">
      <h4 id="h-four_commonly_used_typefaces_for_chinese_composition">Four Frequently-used Typefaces for Chinese Characters <span class="issue">I'm inclined to think that a heading is superfluous here.</span></h4>
      <p>There are four main typefaces in use for Chinese characters: Song, Hei, Kai and Fangsong (Imitation Song). This following sections describe common practice and contexts for use of these four typefaces. </p>
    </section>
    <section id="song">
      <h4 id="h-song">Song/Ming</h4>
      <figure id="fig-song"><span style="text-align:center;"><img src="zh/images/song.png" alt="Picture of Song Type" style="width: 80%"/></span>
        <figcaption>Song</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><dfn>Song</dfn>, also known as Songti or Ming, is a category of typefaces used to display Chinese characters, and currently the most common style of type in print for Chinese. In Mainland China, the most common name is Song while in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and Korea, Ming is prevalent. </p>
      <p>Song is commonly used in text, headings and annotations. When used in headings, the characters will appear in a bold face, so as to distinguish the heading from the text. </p>
    </section>
    <section id="kai">
      <h4 id="h-kai">Kai</h4>
      <figure id="fig-kai"><span style="text-align:center;"><img src="zh/images/kai.png" width="600" height="215"></span>
        <figcaption>Kai</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><dfn>Kai</dfn>, also known as Kaiti or regular script, is another of the major typefaces, and provides calligraphic styles for Chinese characters. It is also the most easily and widely recognized style and shows notable handwriting features. </p>
      <p>Kai is mainly used in text that needs to be differentiated from the rest of the content, for example, headlines, references, quotations, and dialogs. It is rarely used for emphasis, because of its similarity with Song. </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Since Kai retains some calligraphic features, it is widely used in office documents and textbooks. </p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="hei">
      <h4 id="h-hei"><span class="secno">Hei</span></h4>
      <figure id="fig-hei"><span style="text-align:center;"><img src="zh/images/hei.png" alt="Picture of Hei Type" style="width: 80%"/></span>
        <figcaption>Hei</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><dfn>Hei</dfn>, also known as Heiti or Gothic, is a type style characterized by strokes of even thickness, reduced curves, and a lack of decoration. It is commonly used in headlines, signs, and personal names in dialogs. For certain types of text, characters in Kai style with thicker strokes typically indicate emphasis. </p>
      <p>Traditional publications rarely apply the Hei style for content, but with the growing influence of the World Wide Web and the digital publishing industry, some publications are starting to experiment Hei in this context.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="imitation_song">
      <h4 id="h-imitation_song">Fangsong (Imitation Song)</h4>
      <figure id="fig-fangsong"><span style="text-align:center;"><img src="zh/images/fangsong.png" alt="Picture of Fangsong Type" style="width: 80%"/></span>
        <figcaption>Fangsong (Imitation Song)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The <dfn>Fangsong</dfn> (Imitation Song) style lies between Song and Kai. It is commonly used in isolated paragraphs such as quotations or highlighted sentences.</p>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section id="type_area">
    <h3 id="h-type_area">The Type Area (or Printing Area)</h3>
    <p>The <dfn id="def_typeArea">type area</dfn>, sometimes called the printing area, is designed in the following sequence. <span class="issue">There is no actual definition of what the type area is. I suggest we change the foregoing to something like: The <dfn id="def_typeArea2">type area</dfn>, sometimes called the printing area, is the rectangle in the middle of the page that contains the main body of the text. It is surrounded by space containing headers, footers, notes, etc.</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li> First, prepare a template of the page format, which determines the basic appearance of document pages.</li>
      <li> Then, specify the details of actual page elements based on the template.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Books usually use one basic template for page format, whereas magazines often use several templates.</p>
    <p>Although in books, there tends to be one template for the page format, some further design effort based around the basic page format will be needed for pages such as the table of contents and indexes. Furthermore, there are many examples of indexes with a different page format than the basic page format, and vertically set books often have indexes in horizontal writing mode, and sometimes multiple columns. However, while doing actual design for the page, the size of the type area should not exceed the basic page template.<span class="issue"> (have some doubts about the translation of 版面 here)</span>. </p>
    <p>Magazines usually contain various kinds of content, which naturally leads to various designs of templates, different sizes of characters, and varying numbers of columns. </p>
    <section id="main_elements_of_basic_composition">
      <h4 id="h-main_elements_of_basic_composition">Basic Elements of Page Format</h4>
      <p>The following are the basic elements of a page format.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Trim size and binding side (vertically set Chinese documents are bound on the right-hand side, and horizontally set documents are bound on the left-hand side.)</li>
        <li>Principal text direction (vertical writing mode or horizontal writing mode).</li>
        <li>Appearance of the type area and its position relative to the trim size.</li>
        <li> Appearance of running heads and page numbers, and their positions relative to the trim size and type area.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Establishing a type area may be seen as defining not only a rectangular area on a page, but also within that area an underlying, logical grid, to guide the placement of such things as characters, headings, and illustrations. Once the grid is established according to the principles of composition, the setting of the characters must align with the grid. If the content contains Chinese characters only, it is an important principle that the first and last characters on a line should align with the border of the type area. When both Chinese characters and Western text are mixed in the content, or forbidden locations of punctuation marks need to be taken into consideration, the setting of the content may not align with the grid.</p>

      <h4 id="h-designing_elements_of_type_area">Design of the Type Area</h4>
      <p>The type area defines the basic printing style of a book. The following are the basic elements of the type area.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Character size and typeface name </li>
        <li> Text direction (vertical writing mode or horizontal writing mode)</li>

      <ol>
        <li><span class="leadin">Realm and position of headings:</span> The direction and size of the characters of the heading should be based on a number of lines in the type area. The size of the indent is usually specified as a number of characters in the type area. </li>
        <li><span class="leadin">Size of illustrations:</span> In horizontal writing mode, the width of illustrations should, if at all possible, be the width of the type area; in horizontal writing mode with two columns,  the width of illustrations should, if at all possible, be the width of one type area column. The illustrations are usually set at the head or the foot of the page. Likewise,  in vertical writing mode, the height of illustrations should, if at all possible, be either the height of one type area column or the height of the type area. The illustrations are usually set at the right side or left side of the type area.</li>
        <li><span class="leadin">Page for Table of Contents, Indexes and References:</span> The size of the type area for the table of contents, indexes and references of books is based on the size of the type area for the main body content. There are many examples of tables of contents in vertical writing mode where the left-to-right size is identical to that of the type area, but the top-to-bottom size is a little bit smaller. </li>

          <p>Specifying the dimensions of the type area</p>
          <ol>
            <li> For a document with a single column per page, specify the character size, the line length (the number of characters per line), the number of lines per page, and the line gap. </li>
            <li> For a document with multiple columns per page, specify the character size, the line length (the number of characters per line), the number of lines per column, the line-gap,  the number of columns and the column gap.</li>

          <p>Determining the position of the type area relative to the trim size. There are various alternative methods for specifying the position of the type area relative to the trim size:</p>
          <ol>
            <li> Set the type area at the horizontal and vertical center of the trim size.</li>
            <li> Position vertically by specifying the size of the space at the head (for horizontal writing mode) or the space at the foot (for vertical writing mode). Position horizontally by centering the type area.</li>
            <li> Position vertically by centering the type area. Position horizontally by specifying the size of the space for the gutter.</li>
            <li> Position vertically by specifying the space at the head (for horizontal writing mode) or the space at the foot (for vertical writing mode). Position horizontally by specifying the size of the space for the gutter.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <div class="note">
        <p>In most cases the type area is set at the horizontal and vertical center of the trim size, and then it can be adjusted depending on its dimensions. This design method is mainly inherited from the letter press printing technology. For desktop publishing, the dimensions of the type area are usually calculated based on the space between the type area and the trim size.</p>

      <p>The following are considerations that need to be taken into account when designing the type area: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> When deciding the dimensions of the type area, it is necessary to consider both the trim size and the margin. Generally speaking, the shape of the type area could be made similar to that of the trim size.</li>
        <li>
          <p> Character size. For the main target audience of publications, ie. the adult population, most commonly the character size is 10.5pt (≒3.7mm) or 9pt (≒3.2mm). The minimum acceptable size of type is 8pt (≒2.8mm), except for specialized publications. </p>

            <p>There are two traditional size systems for Chinese characters, and old one and a new one. The following shows the equivalence in the Western point system. In the Old size system, Size 0 = 42pt, Size 1 = 27.5pt, Size 2 = 21pt, Size 3 = 15.75pt, Size 4 = 13.75pt, Size 5 = 10.5pt, Size 6 = 7.875pt, and Size 7 = 5.25pt; while 4 lines of New Size 5 is 36pt<span class="ednote">don't understand the foregoing</span>, New Size 1 = 24pt, New Size 2 = 18pt, New Size 3 =  16pt, New Size 4 = 12pt, New Size 5 is 9pt.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="note">
            <p>Size 5 is usually used for text content. Newspapers and magazines use both Size 5 and New Size 5. The acceptable minimal size for the text in content is Size 6  (7.875pt≒2.8mm). If a smaller size is used, it will be difficult to read due to the complex structure of the Chinese characters.</p>

          <p>Line length should be multiples of the character size and each line should be in alignment with each other. </p>
          <div class="note">
            <p>For Chinese composition without intermixed Western scripts, the characters all have a square-shaped frame, so all line lengths except that of the last line of the paragraph should, in principle, be the same.</p>

        <li>
          <p> The line gaps between each line should be the same throughout the book, except for special cases. <span class="issue">It would probably help, at this point, to define what the line gap is, since it initially sounds like the same thing as line height. What are the reference points for measuring the line gap?</span></p>
          <div class="note">
            <p>In Traditional Chinese composition, there are cases where pronunciation marks,  referred to as 'ruby' in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#ruby_and_emphasis_dots">Japanese Layout Requirements</a></span>, are inserted between lines. In such cases the line gap is not changed but is kept constant . If these elements are likely to occur in text, the line gap established during the type area design needs to be of an adequate size to accommodate them.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="note">
            <p>The line gap for the type area is commonly set to a value between 50% and 100% of the height of the character frame used for the type area. A shorter line gap can be chosen in cases where the line length is short or the character size of the type area is relatively small. On the other hand, the line gap usually does not exceed the character size. Increasing the line gap beyond the character size does not improve the reading experience.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="note">
            <p>There is another method of specifying the type area that uses line height rather than line gaps. <dfn id="def_line-height">Line height</dfn> is the distance between two adjacent lines measured from their reference points. The reference point differs from implementation to implementation, however, in vertical writing mode the horizontal center of the character frame is usually used, and with horizontal writing mode, the vertical center of the character frame is used. When the character size is the same for every character, the following calculation is used:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>line height = character size / 2 + line gap + character size / 2 = character size + line gap</li>
              <li>line gap = line height - character size</li>

    <p>The usage of Chinese punctuation marks differs across different regions in China. One of the major differences is their behavior for composition. Punctuation marks in Traditional Chinese are usually positioned center-aligned  with adjacent Han characters, while punctuation marks in Simplified Chinese should be aligned with the character they follow, and this alignment varies according to whether the composition uses vertical or horizontal writing mode. The differences of composition for punctuation in Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese, as well as the correct way to position them, will be introduced in more detail later. </p>
    <p>Major typesetting differences between Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese include the positioning of punctuation and terminological variations. (See more at <a href="#glyphs_sizes_and_positions_in_character_faces_of_punctuation_marks"></a>). </p>
    <div class="note">
      <p>There are differences between the punctuation marks used in China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam, but Unicode does not distinguish them using different codes. A number of punctuation marks are shared among Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese and Japanese. Usually the font used for the Han characters will determine the style of the punctuation marks, or they will be adjusted by the composition engine automatically. </p>

    <p>The content of the following section is mainly based on the content of <cite>General Rules for Punctuation</cite>（GB/T 15834—2011) issued in Mainland China, as well as the <cite>Punctuation Guidance (2008 revised edition)</cite> issued by The Ministry of Education in Taiwan. The former is a recommended national standard while the latter is not mandatory for general publications but mainly used to regulate education materials like textbooks.</p>

        <h5 id="h-pause-or-stop-punctuation-marks">Pause or Stop Punctuation Marks.</h5>
        <p>Pause or stop punctuation marks are used to indicate  pauses or the end of a sentence. Some of the pause or stop punctuation marks appear within a sentence, such as the slight-pause comma, comma, semicolon, colon, etc., while others appear at the end of a sentence, such as period, question mark and exclamation mark.</p>

            <div class="note">
              <p>In many college books, science and technology literature, and grammar books of Western languages, most of which are in horizontal writing mode, Western language text is heavily used. In this case, <span class="uname">U+FF0E FULLWIDTH FULL STOP</span> [．] can be used as period, while <span class="uname">U+002C COMMA</span> [,] or <span class="uname">U+FF0C FULLWIDTH COMMA</span> [，] can be used as comma and slight-pause comma.</p>

            <p><span class="uname">U+FF1A FULLWIDTH COLON</span> [：] consists of two equally sized dots centered on the same vertical line. It is used to explain or start an enumeration and it is also used with ratios, titles and subtitles of books, city and publisher in bibliographies, business letter salutation, hours and minutes, and formal letters. <span class="uname">U+FF1B FULLWIDTH SEMICOLON</span> [；] is a punctuation mark that separates major sentence elements. A semicolon can be used between two closely related independent clauses, provided they are not already joined by a coordinating conjunction. Semicolons can also be used in place of commas to separate items in a list, particularly when the elements of that list contain commas.</p>

        <h5 id="indication_punctuation_marks">Indication <span class="issue">is this the right word? should it be Indicator?</span> Punctuation Marks.</h5>
        <p>In contrast with pause or stop punctuation marks, indication punctuation marks usually indicate a specific feature of the phrase or sentence. They include brackets, parentheses, em dashes, horizontal ellipsis, black circles or bullets, tildes, middle dots, angle brackets, low lines, and solidus. </p>

            <p><span class="leadin">Bracket/Quotation Mark.</span> </p>
            <p>Brackets, usually used in pairs, are commonly used to emphasize certain characters or words, or to indicate the beginning and ending of the dialog or quoted content. If there is a need to use a bracket within a pair of brackets, the shape of the  inner brackets will differ from the parenting brackets. </p>
            <p>When there is a need for quotation marks, Traditional Chinese will apply single quotation marks first and then double quotation marks. Single quotation marks include <span class="uname">U+300C LEFT CORNER BRACKET</span> [「] and <span class="uname">U+300D RIGHT CORNER BRACKET</span> [」]; double quotation marks include <span class="uname">U+300E LEFT WHITE CORNER BRACKET</span> [『] and <span class="uname">U+300F RIGHT WHITE CORNER BRACKET</span> [』].</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Simplified Chinese will apply double quotation marks first and then single quotation marks. For Simplified Chinese, double quotation marks include <span class="uname">U+201C LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK</span> [“], <span class="uname">U+300E LEFT WHITE CORNER BRACKET</span> [『], <span class="uname">U+2019 RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK</span> [”], <span class="uname">U+300F RIGHT WHITE CORNER BRACKET</span> [』]; the single quotation marks include <span class="uname">U+2018 LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK</span> [‘], <span class="uname">U+300C LEFT CORNER BRACKET</span> [「], <span class="uname">U+2019 RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK</span> [’] and <span class="uname">U+300D RIGHT CORNER BRACKET</span> [」]. </p>
            <div class="note">
              <p>Some publications in Traditional Chinese might also apply double quotation marks first and then single quotation marks. </p>

            <p><span class="leadin">Horizontal ellipsis.</span> </p>
            <p>In Chinese, the horizontal ellipsis usually consists of 3 dots, <span class="uname">U+2026 HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS</span> […], or 6 dots (in two groups of three dots, occupying the same horizontal space as two characters, ie. "……"). They usually indicate an intentional omission of a word, sentence, or whole section from a text. Depending on their context and placement in a sentence, ellipses can also indicate an unfinished thought, a leading statement, a slight pause, a mysterious, echoing voice, or a nervous or awkward silence. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="leadin">Emphasis Dots.</span> </p>
            <p>Emphasis dots are symbols placed above or beneath characters to emphasize the text, strengthen the tone, or avoid ambiguity. For horizontal writing mode, the emphasis dots are placed under the characters, whereas in vertical writing mode, they are usually placed to the right side of the characters. Both <span class="uname">U+25CF BLACK CIRCLE</span> [●] or <span class="uname">U+2022 BULLET</span> [•] can work as emphasis dots.</p>
            <p> Punctuation Guidance (revised edition) issued by The Ministry of Education in Taiwan does not include this mark but it is still seen in some publications.</p>

          <li>
            <p><span class="leadin">Connector Symbols.</span></p>
            <p>Connector symbols are used to indicate the beginning and end of time or space, to indicate quantity, to express the name of a chemical compound, to label a table or illustration, to connect a house number in an address, for a phone number, to separate digits which indicate the year, month and date, or to connect compound nouns, for the romanization as well as the foreign text in the content. </p>
            <p>According to the <cite>General Rules for Punctuation（GB/T 15834—2011)</cite>, there are three types of connector symbol, which are the short connector symbol [–], the long connector symbol [—], and tilde [~].</p>
            <div class="note">
              <p>The <cite>General Rules for Punctuation（GB/T 15834—2011)</cite> does not state the corresponding Unicode code point for the three types of connector symbols. However, we can make the deduction that the long connector symbol [—] is <span class="uname">U+2014 EM DASH</span> [—] and the tilde [~] is <span class="uname">U+FF5E FULLWIDTH TILDE</span> [～] . Since the short connector symbol should take half the width of the long connector symbol, it should be <span class="uname">U+2013 EN DASH</span> [–]. The actual length of these connector symbols may depend on the writing system as well as the typeface.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><span class="leadin">Middle Dot.</span> </p>
            <p><span class="uname">U+00B7 MIDDLE DOT</span> [·], also known as interpoint, middot or centered dot, is a punctuation mark consisting of a vertically-centered dot, and is used to separate the first name and family name in names translated from a foreign language, or minority groups names. It is also used with double quotation marks to separate chapters, articles and volumes in publications. </p>
            <p>Middle dot is applied to Chinese only. When a translated foreign name contains a Latin counter, the full stop should be used rather than the middle dot. For example, 「比尔·盖茨」 but 「B. 盖茨」.</p>
            <p> The usage of middle dot differs between Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese. In principle, the middle dot, either in vertical writing mode or horizontal writing mode, should have the same dimensions as a character; while in Simplified Chinese, the middle dot sometimes has  half the width of a character when it is used to separate the month and the date, e.g. 9·11. </p>

      <h4 id="h-glyphs_sizes_and_positions_in_character_faces_of_punctuation_marks">Sizes and positions of Punctuation Marks</h4>
      <p>Please find the shape and usage of punctuation marks at section <a href="#categories_and_usage_of_punctuation_marks"></a> and <a href="#tables_of_chinese_punctuation_marks"></a>. There are no notable differences between the punctuation used in Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese. The major differences between the two are in the dimension and position of the punctuation marks. </p>
      <p>Punctuation marks used in Traditional Chinese are usually positioned in the vertical and horizontal center of the square space left for them; while in vertical writing mode and horizontal writing mode, some of the punctuation marks are positioned in different directions so as to mark the corresponding characters more accurately. For Simplified Chinese, the punctuation marks are usually positioned following the characters they are supposed to mark; while some punctuation marks might be positioned in different directions due to the vertical or horizontal writing mode. Also, different writing modes might require different punctuation marks to fulfill the same function, e.g. horizontal writing mode requires curved quotation marks while vertical writing mode requires angle brackets. </p>
      <p>Pause or stop punctuation marks include the slight-pause comma, comma, semicolon, colon, period, question mark, exclamation mark, etc. In Traditional Chinese, they take the same dimensions as well as the direction as a character does. Traditional Chinese pause or stop punctuation marks are usually positioned in the vertical and horizontal center of the square space left for them. In Simplified Chinese, they are positioned in the top or bottom side in the space left for them following the marked characters. In horizontal writing mode, the pause or stop punctuation marks are placed at the lower left corner in the square space while in vertical writing mode, they are placed in the right upper corner. </p>
      <p>Brackets marks include quotation marks, parentheses, title marks, etc. They should be positioned in pairs at each side of the marked character and have the same dimensions as a character, and the same direction as the characters. Bracket quotation marks have different positioning rules in Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese. In Traditional Chinese, single quotation marks will be used first and then double quotation marks, whereas in Simplified Chinese, double quotation marks will be used first and then single quotation marks. Also, the writing mode should be taken into consideration too. Horizontal writing mode requires curved quotation marks while vertical writing mode requires angle brackets.</p>
      <p>Ellipsis and long dash, in the vertical and horizontal center of the square space for them, should be one character in height and two-characters in width. They are not supposed to be separated from one line to the next and should be positioned in the same direction as the characters. </p>
      <p>Dashes, with the same dimensions as one character, should be positioned in the vertical and horizontal center of the square space for it. Among the dash marks, EN DASH should have a short length to make a clear distinction from the Chinese character [一], which means one. And they should be positioned in the same direction as the characters they mark. </p>
      <p>Solidus, with the same dimensions and direction as the character it follows, should be positioned in the vertical and horizontal center of the square space for it. To make a more economical use of the space, or to set the members or characters more solid, sometimes the solidus can have a half character width. </p>
      <p>Inline marks like title marks, wavy low lines, and emphasis dots should be positioned underneath the marked characters in horizontal writing mode. In vertical writing mode, emphasis dots should be positioned to the right side of the marked characters so as not to affect the characters above and beneath them. </p>
      <p>Solidus should be positioned in the vertical and horizontal center of the square space for it. In Simplified Chinese, it should take half a character width, whereas in Traditional Chinese, there is no clear rule about its dimension but most publications will give them the same dimensions as one character. </p>

      <p> In order to maintain a smooth reading experience and consistency of the style, there are certain constraints for the positioning of most punctuation marks. In most cases, according to its function, a punctuation mark is prohibited from appearing at the line start or line end. This rule was first implemented during the time of letterpress printing. In Mainland China, the national standard <cite>General Rules for Punctuation (GB/T 15834–2011)</cite> sets clear rules about the positioning of punctuation marks. In the regions that use Traditional Chinese, there is not yet a standard for the usage and positioning of punctuation marks, but most of the publications apply the rules described in this document.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <p> In Traditional Chinese, there is no strict rule indicating that a punctuation mark must not appear at the line start. In the time of letterpress printing, there were quite a few publications which ignored the prohibition rules for punctuation marks. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="note">
        <p> In Traditional Chinese publications like newspapers and magazines, columns are often used in the layout, which leads to fewer characters in each line, and prohibition rules of punctuation marks are sometimes ignored under these circumstances.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="note">
        <p>In order to avoid a punctuation mark appearing at the line start, the last character from the previous line can be moved to the beginning of next line and the extra space left for the previous line should be divided and inserted equally between the characters of previous line. However, in the case where several punctuation marks appear together, for example [。』」], moving one character from previous line might cause too much space left between the characters. In this case, the punctuation marks might be allowed to appear at the line start so as to keep a reasonable space between characters in each line. </p>
      </div>
      <p> Pause or stop punctuation marks including slight-pause comma, comma, semicolon, colon, period, question mark, exclamation mark, as well as right quotation marks, right parentheses, right angle brackets, ellipsis, dash, etc, should not appear at the line start. </p>

      <p>The punctuation marks in Chinese usually have the dimensions of one character (or more), will provides a clear distinction between characters and leaves some room for composition adjustment. However, if there is no character before or after the punctuation mark(s), the empty space around the punctuation mark(s) will seem a bit abrupt. In this case, proper compression for the punctuation mark(s) will make the composition more tightly-knit and  readable.</p>
      <p>Usually there are two ways to compress punctuation mark(s). First, when multiple punctuation marks appear together, the space between the punctuation marks can be adjusted; second, when multiple punctuation marks appear at the line start or line end, the space at the line start or line end can be adjusted. </p>

        <p>When opening bracket(s), closing bracket(s), slight-pause comma, comma, period or interpunct appear together, the following rules for space adjustment will make the composition more solid and readable. </p>
        <ol>
          <li> In Simplified Chinese, when one or more closing brackets appear behind a slight-pause comma, comma or period, a space of half a character width can be reduced. This rule does not apply to Traditional Chinese. </li>
          <li> When a slight-pause comma, comma or period appears after a closing bracket, a space of half a character width can be reduced. </li>

      <h4 id="h-hanging_punctuation_marks_at_line_end">Hanging Punctuation at Line End</h4>
      <p>Most Chinese publications do not use hanging punctuation at line end. According to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#positioning_of_punctuation_marks">Japanese Layout Requirements</a> document, hanging punctuation at the line end is a kind of extension of the prohibition rules at line start. This rule helps to avoid moving characters or punctuation marks between lines and avoids inconsistency of space between the characters in different lines. </p>
      <p>In general, the punctuation marks that can be hung at the line end include slight-pause comma, comma and period. In Simplified Chinese, the rest of the pause or stop punctuation marks can be hung at line end since they are set at at the side of the marked characters or in front of the marked characters. </p>
      <p>However, for Traditional Chinese, which sets the punctuation marks at the center of the square space for it, hanging the punctuation marks might make an abrupt affect  on the composition. Therefore, Traditional Chinese does not apply hanging punctuation in horizontal writing mode but only in vertical writing mode. </p>
      <p>In the case of a succession of punctuation marks, punctuation hanging should not be applied. </p>

      <h4 id="h-composition_of_chinese_and_western_mixed_text">Composition of Chinese and Western Mixed Text</h4>
      <p>There are many examples in Chinese text where Western characters, such as Latin letters, Greek letters, or European numerals, are found alongside Han characters. The following are just a few examples:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>One Western letter used as a symbol for something, such as 'A' or 'B'.</li>
        <li>A Western word is used in a Chinese context, such as 'editor'.</li>
        <li>Acronyms, such as 'DTP' or 'GDP'.</li>
        <li> Book titles or authors in references to Western books that use the original spelling.</li>
        <li> European numerals used to express years or other numbers, such as '1999年'.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Western numeric characters are also used in itemized lists and numbered headings, or as symbols for chemical elements or mathematical formulae. It can be seen from these examples that it is an everyday occurrence to find Western characters mixed with Han characters in Chinese composition.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Western numerals, sometimes called arabic, or arabic-indic numerals, are referred to as European numerals in the context of this document, unless notes indicate otherwise.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Formerly, fullwidth ASCII characters were often used, either to make the presentation look orderly, or simply due to the poorly developed computer technologies available for text layout. Nowadays, typesetting engines allow for proportional or monospace fonts, as required, rather than forcing the user to resort to the old  fullwidth blocks of Latin letters and European numerals.</p>
      <p>When Western texts are mixed with Han characters, Chinese style punctuation and its common usage should be used in principle since the main text is Chinese,  However, in the case of technical documents, if plenty of formula are contained in the text, the full stop can be unified with the western-style period, <span class="uname">U+002E FULL STOP</span> [.]. Also in text books on grammar of Western languages etc., which contain plenty of example sentences mixed with Chinese, western-style periods can be used.</p>

      <h4 id="h-mixed_text_composition_in_horizontal_writing_mode">Mixed Text Composition in Horizontal Writing Mode</h4>
      <p>In horizontal writing mode, the basic approach uses proportional fonts to represent Western text and uses proportional or monospace fonts for European numerals. In principle, there is tracking or spacing between an adjacent Han character and Western character of up to one quarter of a Han character width, except at the line head or end.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Another approach is to use a Western word space (<span class="uname">U+0020 SPACE</span>), in which case the width depends on the font in use.</p>

      <h4 id="h-mixed_text_composition_in_vertical_writing_mode">Mixed Text Composition in Vertical Writing Mode</h4>
      <p>For vertical writing mode, the following list describes methods of setting Western letters and European numerals:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="leadin">Setting Western letters with Han character-width monospace fonts</span>. Letters or European numerals follow each other, one at a time, in the same direction and rotation as the Han characters.  This arrangement is usually adopted where the text contains a single letter or digit, or an acronym.</li>
        <li><span class="leadin">Setting Western letters with proportional fonts, rotated 90 degrees clockwise.</span> This approach is usually adopted where Latin letters compose a word or sentence. There is tracking or spacing between a Han character and an adjacent Western letter or European numeral, up to a width of one quarter of a Han character, except at the line head or end.</li>
        <li><span class="leadin">Setting European numerals with proportional fonts in horizontal-in-vertical orientation.</span> This style is usually adopted when dealing with a two to three digit number whose width is equal to the default line advance or slightly wider (within an acceptable range).</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Han numerals are usually used in vertical writing mode, however in recent years it is becoming more common to see fullwidth European numerals and proportional numerals set as horizontal-in-vertical.</p>

      <h4 id="h-handling_western_text_in_chinese_text_using_proportional_western_fonts">Handling Western Text in Chinese Text Using Proportional Western Fonts</h4>
      <p>The following provides composition rules for handling Western characters and European numerals in horizontal writing mode or in situations in vertical writing mode where the Western words/phrases or European numerals are rotated 90 degrees clockwise:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A sequence of Western characters in a Western word should not break across a line-break, except where hyphenation is allowed.</li>
        <li>Tracking or spacing between a Han character and a Western letter or numeral is up to a quarter of the width of a Han character.</li>
        <li>Justified text alignment is an important feature of Chinese composition. It is harder to align text as expected when a line contains Western characters. Typically, spacing or tracking is applied equally across the line, but such adjustments are only applied between Han characters or between Han and Western letters.  The spacing is not equally distributed between characters in Western words and/or European numerals.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Exceptions are made in the following cases:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> Tracking or spacing of Western letters or European numerals before the line head or after the line end are not justified.</li>
        <li> Tracking or spacing of Western letters or European numerals is not adjusted  before or after Chinese commas or full stops, nor after Chinese opening and before Chinese closing brackets.</li>

      <h4 id="h-handling_of_grid_alignment_in_chinese_and_western_mixed_text_composition">Handling of Grid Alignment in Chinese and Western Mixed Text Composition</h4>
      <p>Due to the fact that each Han character is of the same width, not only should characters at the start and end of a line be aligned but it is also a requirement for characters within blocks of Han text to be aligned both vertically and horizontally, whether in vertical or horizontal writing mode.  When Western text or European numerals intervene, this principle is harder to achieve. Possible approaches are listed below:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> Instead of a quarter Han-width tracking between Han and Western letters, it is possible to use flexible spacing of up to half a Han character width.  This brings the space occupied by Western characters to a multiple of the width of a Han character. In this way, both the Han character before and after the Western language span snaps to the grid lines.</li>
        <li> When a Western word appears at the line end and needs to be broken, rather than breaking the word at a syllable boundary per the Western convention, the word may be forced to break at the line end, in order to ensure correct alignment.</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="note">
        <p>When using grid alignment, it is recommended to deal with line end punctuation marks by hanging the first of them outside the type area as mentioned in section <a href="#hanging_punctuation_marks_at_line_end"></a>. In situations that involve consecutive punctuation marks, the second and following punctuation marks are allowed to appear at the line start.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Grid alignment is adopted more often in Traditional Chinese typesetting, whereas use in Simplified Chinese is rare.</p>

      <p>Chinese <dfn id="def_ruby">interlinear annotation</dfn>, also known as ruby, is small, supplementary text attached to certain characters or words in the main text. Chinese interlinear annotation is usually set in the interlinear space and aligned to the corresponding base text which it annotates. In Chinese typesetting, Chinese interlinear annotation is mainly used to indicate pronunciation or meaning.</p>
      <section>
        <h5 id="h-indicating_pronunciation_for_chinese_characters">Indicating the Pronunciation for Chinese characters</h5>
        <p>In Chinese, interlinear annotation is most commonly used to indicate the pronunciation of Han characters. Presenting the pronunciation alongside the characters is a great help to beginners, especially to children who are native speakers, or to foreigners intending to study Chinese. Therefore, it is rare to annotate isolated Han characters. Instead, phonetic annotations tend to cover the full text. Also, it is not regular practice in Chinese layout to use interlinear annotation for pronunciation outside these educational contexts, even for the pronunciation of rarely used characters, although sometimes pronunciation is provided inline, possibly inside brackets.</p>
        <p>There are two major annotation systems for indicating Chinese pronunciation: Zhuyin and Romanization.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p class="leadin">Zhuyin.</p>
            <p>Mandarin Phonetic Symbols (國語注音符號) or Taiwanese Dialect Phonetic Symbols (台灣方言音符號), hereinafter referred to as ‘Zhuyin’, are systems for phonetic annotation mainly used in Taiwan, although other areas may also include Zhuyin in certain dictionaries or textbooks. In most cases, Zhuyin appears on the right side of its corresponding base text. Exceptions are very rare.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="leadin">Romanization.</p>
            <p>Hanyu Pinyin (汉语拼音), now the official standard in Mainland China, uses the Latin alphabet to transcribe the Modern Standard Chinese (Mandarin) pronunciations of Chinese characters. The most common use case in Mainland China is to indicate the pronunciation for all characters of the full text with Hanyu Pinyin. In Taiwan and Hong Kong, the arrangement of the Taiwanese Romanization System for Minnan (台灣閩南語羅馬字), the Romanization System of the Hong Kong Education and Manpower Bureau (教育學院拼音方案) or romanization systems of other Chinese dialects are similar to those of Hanyu Pinyin. </p>
            <p>Due to the characteristics of the Latin alphabet, such annotations appear in horizontal writing mode only. Texts for children who are native speakers usually provide reading assistance for each individual character, while texts for those who are learning Chinese as a second language mainly indicate pronunciation for whole words, but occasionally, both of them are set almost the same. There is space between the base text when whole words are annotated, and the interlinear annotation characters will have unique requirements such as sentence case, or punctuation marks corresponding to base characters. Early publications using Pinyin are very varied and lack consistency. Both character-based and word-based annotations are quite common. No further description of the early pinyin will be found in this document.</p>

          <li>
            <p class="leadin">Bilingual Annotations.</p>
            <p>Bilingual annotations aim to provide a Chinese translation of text in foreign languages or acronyms, or to offer the original text for words that have been translated into Chinese. This is mainly used for proper nouns, titles or those terms whose concepts are difficult to convey after translation. It is commonly found in translated works, mainly in light novels.</p>

          <li>
            <p class="leadin">Interlinear Comments.</p>
            <p>Interlinear comments are ways to annotate the meaning of text fragments or a single word, and are so named for their interlinear positioning. They usually lie in the interlinear space and co-exist with the body text. Compared to other annotation methods, i.e. headnotes or footnotes, interlinear comments are more compact and stick better to the body. These kinds of comments are often found in ancient books, such as Rouge Inkstone, an early commentary of the novel Dream of the Red Chamber.</p>

      <h3>Overview of Interlinear Annotation Positioning</h3>
      <p>In vertical writing mode, Zhuyin, Romanization or bilingual annotations are usually placed on the right side of the base text (Han characters), while interlinear comments are often placed on the left side.</p>
      <p>In horizontal writing mode, Zhuyin can be placed above the base text, but in most cases they are still set to the right side of the base text. On the other hand, Romanization and bilingual annotations can appear both above or below the base text, and the interlinear comments are usually placed at the bottom of the base text.</p>
      <p>In principle, Zhuyin Phonetic Symbols are of the same size, and the number of Zhuyin symbols for one Han character is never more than three, which is quite easily manageable. Romanization, however, uses Latin letters whose sizes are proportional, their composed lengths are varied and there should be spaces between the words. Thus, these two kinds of phonetic annotations differ greatly in positioning.</p>
      <p>Annotating with both Romanization and Zhuyin is a practical way to indicate the reading to readers who know only one of these systems, as well as helping study of or enquiries about the other one. Normally, when Romanization and Zhuyin are both provided, the Zhuyin are placed on the right side of the Han character while Romanization is set at the bottom of the Han character in horizontal writing mode and to the left side in vertical writing mode.</p>

        <p> According to the <cite>Manual of Mandarin Phonetic Symbols</cite> (國語注音符號手冊) released by the Ministry of Education in Taiwan, there are two standard ways of positioning Zhuyin: above the corresponding Han character (horizontal Zhuyin), or on the right side of the corresponding Han character (vertical Zhuyin). The use cases for putting Zhuyin above the base characters are rarely found in today's textbooks or other publications, and it is rarely used by the public at large. Therefore, it's always better practice to place Zhuyin annotations on the right side of their corresponding Han character, whether in horizontal or vertical writing mode.</p>

      <section>
        <h5 id="h-choice_of_size_and_ratio_for_zhuyin">Choice of Size and Ratio for Zhuyin Symbols</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Considering a Han character a square with an aspect ratio of 30:30, the ratio of width to height of its Zhuyin annotation will be set as 15:30. The Zhuyin annotation should stay adjacent to its corresponding base character.</li>
          <li>The aspect ratio of initials, medials and finals is 9:9, while that of Mandarin non-neutral tones and dialect non-checked tones is 5:5, that of Mandarin neutral tones is 9:2, and that of dialectal checked tones is 5:5. More details and figures can be found in  Positioning of Different Composition for the Tones below.</li>
          <li> When the font size of the body is relatively small, it's possible to provide a larger font size for the Zhuyin rather than using the default ratio listed above. Alternatively, other methods, such as bracketing Zhuyin inline, are acceptable.</li>

      <section>
        <h5 id="h-basic-requirements">Basic Requirements</h5>
        <ol>
          <li> Romanization is only available in horizontal writing mode. These phonetic annotations are usually placed on top of the base text. In general, phonetic annotations and their base text stick to each other regardless of space, and both of them are centered-aligned.</li>
          <li> In special cases where Romanization is needed in vertical writing mode, the annotations are usually set to the right side of their corresponding base text, but it is difficult to read anyway.</li>
          <li> If a Romanized annotation is longer than its base text and is at the line head or end, both the annotation and the base text can be aligned to the beginning of the line head or end.</li>
          <li> The space between two adjacent annotations should not be smaller than the size of a normal Western-language space, which is about 1/4 em. Due to the limitation of the typesetting technologies, there is usually no space between the rather long phonetic annotations in many printed publications. Luckily, this is not likely to lead to ambiguity because each Han character contains one syllable and most Pinyin fragments are easy to tell apart. However, these annotations can be misleading sometimes. For example, character-based phonetic annotations may result in the false impression that they are word-based. Also, the accidentally concatenated annotations may disrupt word boundaries, which alters the semantic meanings of the words.</li>
          <li> Annotations are allowed to extend to the top of adjacent base text as long as the minimum spacing is ensured. </li>
          <li> As most target readers are beginners to Chinese, the body text is usually in larger sizes and in the Kai typeface.</li>
          <li> Due to the fact that Latin letters are proportional (width unknown) and that the advance widths in different typefaces deviate greatly from one another, the relationship between the sizes of annotations and their base text is somewhat undetermined. Under the influence of the typesetting of Japanese furigana, however, annotations are usually of half size of the base text.</li>
          <li> Annotations usually use a sans-serif typeface which is rather thin and plump.  It is generally the opinion in publishing and in education that Hanyu Pinyin must use those typefaces in which ‘a’ and ‘g’ are single story and the second tone mark is thick on the lower part and thin on the upper, as in the handwritten style of the stroke. Actually there have never been any national standards specifying the typefaces and the glyphs for Hanyu Pinyin. </li>
          <li> The General Association of Chinese Culture in Taiwan once wrote to the Ministry of Education in Mainland China about the rules for the glyphs of Hanyu Pinyin, and received the response that the glyphs of the letter ‘a’ and ‘g’ correspond to those of Latin. There is no requirement demanding the handwritten glyphs.</li>

          <li> Both the phonetic annotations and the base text are separated at word boundaries. The adjacent annotations are separated by a space approximately 1/2 em wide, while the tracking inside the base text is usually normal.</li>

      <p>A paragraph, a section of a document which consists of one or more sentences to indicate a distinct idea, usually begins on a new line. For the related line head indent at the beginning of paragraphs, the following methods are available. </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>For Chinese publications, line head indent at the beginning of a paragraph usually uses two character-width spaces. Publications like magazines, with multi-column content and less text in each column, might apply a single character-width line head indent at the beginning of paragraph as well. </p>
      </div>
      <ol>
        <li>Line head indent at the beginning of a paragraph is applied to all paragraphs. Nearly all books and magazines make use of this method.</li>
        <li>Line head indent does not apply to the first paragraph but to the rest of the paragraphs. This method is mostly seen in Western publications.</li>
        <li>Line head indent at the beginning of a paragraph is not applied for any paragraph at all. A certain amount of space is inserted between the paragraphs so as to indicate the distinction of different paragraphs. In some books and magazines this method is applied.</li>
        <li>In principle, some unfinished paragraphs should be broken rather than apply the line head indent for the following paragraph. Dialogs, quotations or subtitles that the editor inserted might appear before the unfinished paragraph.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>原則上，在中文書籍排版中各段落間不使用間距，前段落末行、後段落首行與段落內行距一致。若段落間加入空白行，則表示一節的結束。但段落首行不縮排時所加入的段落間距則與傳統排版有所差異，不適合加入空行做節的區分，避免過多的留空造成體裁不良。</p>
      <p>除縮排外，也有首行不縮排、次行起至末行縮排的狀況，稱為凸排。例如劇本中的對白，首行以人名開頭不縮排，第二行起縮排。編號列表、問答、法律條文等也使用此種方式處理。雖稱為凸排，但首行開始處不超過版心所設定的範圍。</p>
      <p>凸排時，次行起縮排通常為固定量的空白，例如人名三字加冒號共四字，凡遇對話時次行皆縮排四個全型空白。遇人名少於三字時，則於姓與名間加入空白，以保持體例一致。</p>

    <section id="line_head_indent_of_paragraphs">

      <p>The paragraph indent is the indentation of the line head by a fixed amount, starting from the line head side of the type area (in the case of one column) or of the column area (in the case of several columns).This method is usually applied for quotations, poetry or subtitles in a paragraph or between the paragraphs. </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Generally speaking, the characters in the paragraphs which apply paragraph indent should be the same as the characters in the body content. Sometimes, due to the different typefaces, the size of characters in the paragraphs which apply paragraph indent differ from the characters in the body content. In this case, a certain amount of space might be added before and after the indent paragraph so as to make a clear distinction from other paragraphs. The space added is usually an integer times the height of paragraphs in the body content</p>

If there is not solid setting but a fixed space between characters, this is used; the end of the character sequence is unified with the line end, and if the line is not full, the line head is kept empty.</p>

        <li>
          <p class="leadin">Even inter-character spacing</p>
          <p>The space between adjacent characters is, in principle, set solid. Also, if there is an explicit instruction to insert spaces, such spaces are inserted. In addition, using the space made available during line adjustment processing, equal character spacing is applied where possible. The start of the character sequence is aligned to the position of the line head, and the end of the character sequence to the position of the line end.</p>
          <p>Two use cases for even inter-character spacing: </p>
          <ol>
            <li>A frequently seen case of even inter-character spacing is that, after applying the punctuation prohibition rules to each line, some lines will have more than one character space left, so in order to align the beginning and ending with the rest of the lines, this line should apply even inter-character spacing.</li>
            <li>Even inter-character spacing is often used for listing names of people or objects. The last line of a paragraph or a paragraph with only one line can have even inter-character spacing applied as well. </li>

      <h4 id="h-adjustments_of_orphans_and_widows">Handling of Widows and Orphans</h4>
      <p>In the tradition of Chinese composition, an orphan does not make a line, nor does a widow make a page. The principles are as described below. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>If there is only one character or one character with a punctuation mark left in the last line of a paragraph, this character is called an orphan. An orphan can be processed using the following methods, so that more than two characters can be positioned in the last line of a paragraph. </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Similar to the handling for the prohibition rule that a punctuation marks should not appear at the line start, the last character of the previous line can be moved the next line, and the previous line should apply even inter-character spacing.</li>
            <li>Delete some character(s) of the previous paragraph so that there will be enough space to move the orphan to the previous line.</li>
            <li>Adding more characters to the last line.</li>
          </ol>
          <div class="note">
            <p>The definition of orphan in Chinese typesetting has some similarity with the definition of orphan in Latin typesetting. See more content in section <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-latinreq/#orphans">5.2</a> of <cite>Requirements for Latin Text Layout and Pagination</cite>. </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If the first line of a paragraph in a page is the last line of a paragraph from the previous page, it is called a widow. A widow can be handled via the following methods.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Move the widow line to the previous page and it can go beyond the tape area.</li>
            <li>Move the last line of the previous page to join the widow.</li>
            <li>Delete some characters of the paragraph so that there will be enough space for the widow to be moved to the previous page.</li>
            <li>Add more characters to the widow so that there will be more than two lines on the page.</li>
          </ol>
          <div class="note">
          <p>The definition of widow in Chinese typesetting has some similarity with the definition of widow in Latin typesetting. See more content at session <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-latinreq/#widows">5.1</a> of <cite>Requirements for Latin Text Layout and Pagination</cite>.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Orphans and widows might differ in the cases below:</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>There is only one line in a page and the line consists of one character and a punctuation mark, which makes the text an orphan and widow at the same time.</li>
        <li>There are multiple paragraphs in a page but the first line is a widow and the first line consists of one character and a punctuation mark, which makes the orphan and widow appear together.</li>
        <li>There is only one line in a page, which makes the line a widow.</li>
        <li>There are multiple paragraphs in a page but the first line is a widow.</li>
        <li>There are multiple paragraphs in a page but one of the lines consists of one character only, which make the only character an orphan.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>There are different viewpoints about how the orphans and widows should be handled in the cases above due to differences between publishers. Case (a) and case (b) have a bigger affect on the typesetting while case (c) affects it less. Cases (d) and (e) are seem more rarely.</p>

      <h4 id="h-types_of_headings">Types of Headings</h4>
      <p>In terms of text composition, there are three types of headings.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Whole-page headings</li>
        <li> Block headings</li>
        <li> Run-in headings</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Due to the composition requirements, magazines usually handle headings in a variety of ways, while most  books have their headings set up in a simpler way. Methods for handling of headings for magazines will not be described in this document. </p>
      </div>
      <p>Whole page headings are used when there is a need to separate sections in a book, usually on a separate page with the following page left blank. Sometimes subheadings, selected sentences, names of the authors or selected paragraphs will also appear with the heading. The back side of the whole page heading page is not necessarily always blank, for example,consider the Han-tobira in Japanese books, whose following even page is not blank, and is used for the main text. </p>
      <p>A block heading is the heading occupying a whole, independent line. The main text is set from the very next line. Top level headings and medium level headings are of this type. </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Headings are subtitles, which separate and indicate sub-parts with one coherent set of content. Headings are usually classified into several levels such as top level heading, medium level heading and low level heading.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="note">
        <p>The sequence of the headings on a page should be the name of the book, section heading, top level heading, medium level heading and then low level heading.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="note">
        <p>In multi-column format, block headings sometimes span multiple columns. This style is called &quot;cross column heading&quot;. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="note">
        <p> In multi-column format, block headings sometimes span multiple columns. These are called cross-column headings.</p>
      </div>
      <p>A run-in heading is a heading immediately followed by main text without a line break, and is usually used as a low level heading. Note that a low level heading can also appear as a block heading.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><span class="leadin">Character size for the heading:</span> The character size of headings should be selected as appropriate in accordance with the level of headings. For example, when the character size of main text is 9 point, the small-headings are usually set with 10 points, medium-headings are usually set with 12 points and large-headings are usually set with 14 points. The character size of headings is usually larger than main text, and the character size of higher level headings are larger than the size of smaller size headings.
          <div class="note">
            <p><span class="needspostedit">也有採用將本文文字尺寸依照比例放大的方式，使用這方式時，以10%–20%上下，依階層放大為佳。</span></p>

        <li><span class="leadin">Type faces for headings:</span> Both Hei or bold Song are usually used. Other type face designs like Yuan and Kai are sometimes used as well.

          <div class="note">
            <p> The number of characters of line head indent for a heading depends on the heading level. If the heading level is higher, the indent character number is less, if the heading level is lower, the number of indent characters is more. The character size is based on the main text of the type area. The differences of character numbers are usually around two characters. </p>

      <h4 id="h-handling_of_new_retros">How to Handle Headings with New Recto and Page Break</h4>
      <p>A large heading sometimes starts with a new page following a page break, to clarify the separation between sections, in which case the process below should be followed:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Always begin with odd pages, i.e. new recto.
          <div class="note">
            <p>Books      usually begin with page 1. Accordingly, vertical writing mode and books      bound on the right-hand side begin with a left page, horizontal writing      mode and books bound on the left-hand side begin with a right page after a      new recto. </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> Always begin with new pages, regardless of even pages or odd pages, i.e. page breaking. Used for large-heading.</li>
        <li> When medium-headings or small-headings appear at the last line of a page and there is no space left for the following paragraphs, the medium-headings or small-headings should be moved to the next page so as to make a proper composition. </li>

      <p>Spaces just before new rectos, page breaks and new columns are treated as follows (the last pages are treated as the same): </p>
      <ol>
        <li> In the case of single column typesetting, the spaces just before the new rectos and page breaks are left as they are.</li>
        <li> In the case of multiple columns, the remaining space of preceding columns is left as it is.</li>
        <li> In the case of vertical writing mode, columns are filled with text lines from upper right to lower left. There is no need to align line numbers of the upper column and lower column, and remaining spaces are left as they are.</li>
        <li> In horizontal writing mode and multi-column format, the number of lines for each column is set to be the same, but where the result of the total number of lines divided by the column number chosen for the type area results in an odd number, the last column may have a smaller number of lines and may be followed by blank space.</li>

    <section id="processing_of_runin_headings">
      <h4 id="h-processing_of_runin_headings">Processing of Run-in Headings</h4>
      <p>Run-in headings are usually used for low level headings. The following are some examples of run-in headings. Inter-character space between the run-in heading and following main text is usually a one character space of the base character size decided for the type area. Note that the run-in heading may be set at the last line of the page, or of the column in multi column style.</p>
      <ol>
        <li> The run-in heading is set with the same character size as the main text and with Hei or Song. </li>
        <li> Set the run-in heading with one level smaller character size than the main text and use Hei or Song.
          <div class="note">
            <p>The space that the run-in headings take is not an integer times larger than the characters in the body content, and the space between the run-in headings and body content can be adjusted so as to align the body content as well as the line start and line end.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> Set the run-in heading with the same character size and type-face as the main text. Note that heading numbers or Western characters  are added in front of the heading.</li>
